                    <p>Several days ago, I released an update to the <a href="/serverless/coldstarts/">Serverless Cold Starts</a> section of my website. The most significant change to the previous dataset seems to be in how GCP treats idle instances of Google Cloud Functions.</p>
<p>Cold starts are expensive, so all cloud providers preserve a warm instance of a cloud function even when the application is idle. If the function stays unused for an extended period, such idle instance might eventually be recycled.</p>
<p>Azure Functions recycles its instances after 20 minutes of idling. AWS Lambda has no fixed value, but in practice, it&rsquo;s between 25 and 65 minutes of idling.</p>
<h2 id="recycling-of-idle-instances-in-google-cloud-functions">Recycling of Idle Instances in Google Cloud Functions</h2>
<p>The behavior of Google Cloud Functions used to look quite random: an idle instance could survive for 5 hours or die after 5 minutes.</p>

<p>It seems that this chart shows fewer points, but that&rsquo;s deceptive: the points are just much denser and almost all of the responses are warm! Even after 4-5 hours of idling, the instance survives most of the time.</p>
<p>The following chart estimates the probability (Y-axis) of a cold start by the interval between two subsequent requests (X-axis). A higher line means higher chances of an instance being recycled:</p>

<p>After 5 hours of idling, an instance of 128 MB is 2.5x more likely to be recycled compared to a 2 GB instance.</p>
<p>A similar effect is observed for language runtimes:</p>

<p>While Python and Javascript are in the same ballpark, Go functions seem to survive longer and more reliably.</p>
<h2 id="practical-takeaway">Practical Takeaway</h2>
<p>Cloud providers are fighting the cold starts on many fronts. Now, it seems that Google found a way to keep warm container instances idle for extended periods without too much overhead for their infrastructure.</p>
<p>With this recent improvement, the practice of having a dummy timer-based trigger to keep function instances warm gets less useful. Which is a good thing: less hand-holding and management means more time on developing useful features! One tiny step closer to a serverless nirvana.</p>
