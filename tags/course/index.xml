      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was playing with &lt;a href=&#34;http://aurelia.io&#34;&gt;Aurelia&lt;/a&gt; SPA framework, which makes heavy use of jspm and SystemJS for modules/packaging. This package manager is new to me, and it looked a bit like magic sometimes. So when I saw a jspm course on Pluralsight, I decided to give it a try. And I did not regret: the course is great. It&amp;rsquo;s so good, that I decided to write a review for it, even though I have never done that before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
