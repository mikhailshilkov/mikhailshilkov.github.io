      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was playing with &lt;a href=&#34;http://aurelia.io&#34;&gt;Aurelia&lt;/a&gt; SPA framework, which makes heavy use of jspm and SystemJS for modules/packaging. This package manager is new to me, and it looked a bit like magic sometimes. So when I saw a jspm course on Pluralsight, I decided to give it a try. And I did not regret: the course is great. It&amp;rsquo;s so good, that I decided to write a review for it, even though I have never done that before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>One certificate missing, one received unexpectedly</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I want to give a note about two more online courses that I completed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last one (10 weeks in September-November) was called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/course/compfinance&#34;&gt;Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics&lt;/a&gt; and was lead by Eric Zivot from University of Washington. First of all, it was the most intense course out of all that I took to date. Every of 10 weeks we had about 3-4 hours of videos + homework. The course material was mostly about maths and statistics, and less about application in economics. However, some concepts were new to me and sounded very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introduction to Finance class at Coursera</title>
      <link>https://mikhail.io/2012/11/01/finance-class-at-coursera/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently received a statement of accomplishment document for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/&#34; title=&#34;Coursera&#34;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s online &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/course/introfinance&#34; title=&#34;Introduction to Finance class&#34;&gt;Introduction to Finance class&lt;/a&gt; that I took in July-September this year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;finance.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Finance&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The course was lead by prof. Gautam Kaul from University of Michigan. The level of lectures was really introductory, the pace was very slow (too slow for me, even watching x1.5 speed). You could learn about basic finance principles like time value of money, calculating cash flows and discounted values, about stocks and bonds, and risk/return relations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gamification class at Coursera</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently received a statement of accomplishment document for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/&#34; title=&#34;Coursera&#34;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s online &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/course/gamification&#34; title=&#34;Gamification class&#34;&gt;Gamification class&lt;/a&gt; that I took in August-October this year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;gamification.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gamification certificate&#34; title=&#34;Gamification certificate&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The course was lead by prof. Kevin Werbach from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. He told us about applying game techniques to non-game world problems: business, social etc. In essence, it&amp;rsquo;s on how to add FUN to processes, that are not supposed to be fun at all. Which is really cool. I loved both informative and well-producted lectures, and peer-reviewed assignments that appeared to be&amp;hellip; fun :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Scott E Page is a cool teacher who knows how to explain things in simple words and speaks very fast :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Machine Learning class at Stanford online</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Several days ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve received a Statement of Accomplishment document from Andrew Ng and Machine Learning online class team.&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;mlstatement.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;MLStatement&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My score is below the maximum just because I started about two weeks late, and thus got a penalty for first exercises.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
