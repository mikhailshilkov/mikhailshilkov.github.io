      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love functional programming for the simplicity that it brings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, I realize that learning functional programming is a challenging&#xA;process. FP comes with a baggage of unfamiliar vocabulary that can be daunting for&#xA;somebody coming from an object-oriented language like C#.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The newer and much longer version of this article is now available:&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mikhail.io/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again/&#34;&gt;Monads explained in C# (again)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It looks like there is a mandatory post that every blogger who learns functional programming should write:&#xA;what a Monad is. Monads have the reputation of being something very abstract and very confusing for every&#xA;developer who is not a hipster Haskell programmer. They say that once you understand what a monad is, you&#xA;loose the ability to explain it in simple language. Doug Crockford was the first one to lay this rule down, but&#xA;it becomes kind of obvious once you read 3 or 5 explanations on the web. Here is my attempt, probably doomed&#xA;to fail :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
