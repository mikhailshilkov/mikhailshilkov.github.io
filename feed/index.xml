            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>My humble story of getting (or not) a job at Amazon, Qualcomm, Jet.com, Pulumi, and more</blockquote>

<h2 id="interviews">Interviews</h2>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m reasonably good at passing job interviews.</p>

<p>When I was open for a job change a couple of years ago, I interviewed at eight local companies here in the Netherlands. I got job offers from seven of them. Of course, I have enough experience, and the market was scorching and candidate-friendly.</p>

<p>Besides, Dutch interviews are not as extensive compared to major tech companies in the U.S. For me, it took from 40 minutes to 4 hours of conversations to get to offer negotiation. There would typically be no whiteboard coding or take-home assignments.</p>

<p>I had two interviews at the U.S. companies too. I got offers from both of them.</p>

<p>Amazon flew me to Stockholm for a hiring event. Before jumping on a plane, I spent a day or two studying interviews at Amazon and an algorithms book. Amazon hired a hotel room and hosted four 1-hour sessions with me. There was a whiteboard standing, and every new interviewer would give me a coding or design challenge to solve within that hour. I wasn&rsquo;t well-calibrated for such interviews, and couldn&rsquo;t quite tell if I&rsquo;m performing well. Apparently, I was okay, because I got an open offer for Canada, U.S., Luxembourg, and Germany to work on some Amazon projects.</p>

<p>I also had an interview with Jet.com&mdash;Amazon&rsquo;s competitor in retail&mdash;for a position in Dublin. Two online live-coding interviews, four onsite interviews with whiteboards: a tad stressful but also fun. Coincidentally, the onsite in Dublin was two weeks after the Amazon interview, and the offers came literally on the same day.</p>

<h2 id="no-interviews">No-Interviews</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s one big problem with this narrative. I declined all of those nine offers.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel like these were enough of a step forward for me. Offers from Amazon and Jet were cool, but not revolutionary enough to relocate away from a well-arranged life.</p>

<p>There were more declined offers in the past. In fact, in my whole 18-years (oh gosh) career as a software developer, I only accepted a single job offer after an interview process. I left that company nine months later, despite being already promoted in my role.</p>

<p>How did I get other jobs? Honestly, it felt like they happened by chance.</p>

<p>I got my first paid gig from my father when I was an 18-year-old student. He showed me screenshots of the applications from work and asked me if I can create that kind of apps. He knew nothing about software development but needed a bunch of utilities to calibrate hardware that they were working on.</p>

<p>Sure, I knew Delphi and C++ Builder, so I could make form-based apps. I prototyped one and got my first $100 paycheck. I started working for the company and spent the next three years learning the tech and taking over existing code. By the end of that engagement, I was writing all software in their stack from C code on microcontrollers with directly addressable memory to 60-screen Windows apps.</p>

<p>There wasn&rsquo;t much to learn there anymore. Still being a student, I hopped on a three-week bootcamp organized by a software consultancy company. They were teaching free classes to promote the best students to FTEs. I scored a second place on the overall leaderboard and got hired at the double my previous salary.</p>

<p>I spent five years there, learning from many amazing people. I tried myself in different roles from an individual coder to a technology &ldquo;expert&rdquo; to a team lead to a project manager. The company has been doing contracting projects for European customers (&ldquo;outsourcing&rdquo;).</p>

<p>In the end, I quit the company to try contracting on my own. A friend of mine connected me to somebody in the Netherlands who needed help with his ongoing projects. The guy just gave me the first task, I completed it, he paid. The second task, the first lengthy project, the second project, and I got rolling.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working in my bedroom for the next four years. My contact in the Netherlands got hired by Qualcomm and switched me to their projects. Eventually, Qualcomm decided to hire me full-time, and my family moved from Russia to the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Most certainly, Qualcomm had an extensive process for hiring, so I did fly over for an onsite &ldquo;interview&rdquo;. The interview lasted 5 minutes: I said hi to everyone and then worked on the project for the rest of the day.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-passion">Follow The Passion</h2>

<p>The other day, I interviewed somebody for a developer role at Pulumi, where I currently work. They had a screening interview first, and now going through five rounds of tech interviews. Live-coding, design questions, debugging problems, tell-me-about-the-time-when situations. Very common for anyone applying for a software engineering job in the U.S.</p>

<p>Except, I never had a single interview at Pulumi. I jumped on their product as a user as soon as the first beta went public. I enjoyed the product, published blog posts, used it for my pet projects, gave one of the first Pulumi talks in Europe.</p>

<p>When I was in Seattle for the Microsoft MVP summit, I pinged Pulumi Slack and grabbed a beer with Luke, our CTO. Soon after, I started doing paid contracting for Pulumi: writing blogs, docs, examples, then fixing tiny issues here and there. Eventually, I went to Seattle for the Pulumi 1.0 launch and a week onsite. Finally, after 12 months as a user and 6 months as a contractor, I got the contract signed for full-time employment.</p>

<p>I had no interviews. When I first started, I had zero experience with Go and very limited TypeScript, our main programming languages. I&rsquo;m not a compiler guru, not ingrained into DevOps ecosystem, never worked on developer tooling or open-source SDKs.</p>

<p>However, I thoroughly enjoy my job. It means a lot to me. I love learning from exceptional people, and I have a lot of freedom.</p>

<h2 id="off-the-beaten-track">Off The Beaten Track</h2>

<p>There were two categories of companies that I interacted with. The first group invited me for an interview, and the second group allowed me to collaborate without a formal hiring process. I consistently chose to work in the latter group and enjoyed my time there. Why?</p>

<p>Every such job meant going out of a local maximum, out of comfort zone. Working on calibration software without any experience with metrology. Jumping between consulting projects, teams, and roles. Relocating to another country to join a multi-national company. Becoming one of the two non-U.S. employees at a DevOps tooling startup without ever seeing bash before.</p>

<p>None of these were &ldquo;the next logical step&rdquo; in my career. Maybe I could pass interviews at those companies, perhaps I wouldn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s mostly irrelevant because there wouldn&rsquo;t be a sequence of events to land me at a business-as-usual interview at one of those companies.</p>

<h2 id="expand-your-circle">Expand Your Circle</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of arguments about the interview process being broken. A candidate spends several hours solving computer science puzzles on a whiteboard to get a job of fixing bugs in a React app. Companies may be too strict at not accepting great candidates and hiring unfit candidates at the same time. Perhaps that&rsquo;s all true.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually making a different point. A successful job search doesn&rsquo;t have to be centered around an interview. If my experience generalizes to others at all, here are some activities that may help you get the next great job:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Build a strong professional network</strong>. And not just a bunch of hiring managers. Diverse connections might perform even better since you&rsquo;d get access to a broad set of opportunities. You don&rsquo;t know what you are looking for anyway.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Keep learning and be curious</strong>, even a topic seems to bring no immediate value. The goal is expanding your surface area of interest, curiosity, and skills.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Take part-time gigs</strong>, contracting, one-off apps. They probably won&rsquo;t make you rich on their own. Still, successful low-risk engagement with somebody may lead to longer happy and fulfilling relationships.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Build a public profile</strong>. Publish your code, write blogs, share your interests, design, run, and publish experiments. More than once was I surprised about the way this helped me with jobs, networking, learning, or getting a consulting gig.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And if you are wearing a hiring hat, try to give your potential future workers a chance to engage without full-blown employment commitment. Asking me to code a simple but useful real-life application. Running a free class for software engineering students. Hiring temporary contractors from distant countries. Those companies get me as their employee.</p>

<p>Enough about myself! I&rsquo;m keen to learn about your experience. Whether you can relate to my story or disagree with my take, please leave a comment below.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Azure Functions introduce a data-driven strategy to pre-warm serverless applications right before the next request comes in</blockquote>

<p>Developers and decision-makers often mention <a href="/serverless/coldstarts/">cold starts</a> as a significant drawback of serverless functions. Cloud providers continually invest in reducing the latency of a cold start, but they haven&rsquo;t done much to prevent them altogether. The most common technique is to keep a worker alive for 10-20 minutes after each request, hoping that another request comes in and benefits from the warm instance.</p>

<p>This simple strategy works to some extent, but it&rsquo;s both wasteful in terms of resource utilization and not particularly helpful for low-usage applications. Is there an alternative strategy that could adapt to the workload, reduce the frequency of cold starts, <em>and</em> be more efficient?</p>

<p>In <a href="/2020/05/serverless-in-the-wild-azure-functions-usage-stats">Azure Functions Production Usage Statistics</a>, I reviewed the first part of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03423.pdf">Serverless in the Wild</a> paper, which outlines statistics of Azure Functions running in production. Actually, the ultimate goal of that paper is to suggest an improvement to the cold start mitigation policy and validate the proposed strategy based on the data.</p>

<p>This article is my second installment of the paper review. I focus on the idea of predicting future invocations and pre-warming of serverless workers. I describe the current state of cold starts, then explain the suggested improvements from the paper. Finally, I present my own take on those ideas.</p>

<p>The new policy is definitely worth studying because it will be applied to your Azure Functions soon!</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>As the statistics show, many Azure Function Apps are called very infrequently. Let&rsquo;s consider a concrete example: an HTTP-triggered function that runs approximately once per hour and returns current data for a report.</p>

<p>Currently, every invocation of such a function would hit a cold start. Specifically, Azure uses a fixed “keep-alive” policy that retains the resources in memory for 20 minutes after execution. This isn&rsquo;t helpful in our scenario since requests come every 60 minutes.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-2 pl-0"></div>
    <div class="col-lg-9 flex-first flex-lg-unordered">
        <div class="article-post">

<p>In this specific case, the fixed policy is problematic for everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users hit a cold start every time, which significantly increases the response time.</li>
<li>Azure wastes resources on keeping a warm instance in memory for 20 minutes every hour without any benefits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Indeed, cloud providers seek to achieve high function performance at the lowest possible resource cost. They can&rsquo;t keep all functions in memory all the time: as the stats show, most functions run very seldom, so keeping all of them warm would be a massive waste of resources.</p>

<p>What if the cloud provider could observe each application and adapt the policy for each application workload according to its actual invocation frequency and pattern?</p>

<h2 id="optimal-strategy-predicts-the-future">Optimal Strategy Predicts The Future</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a hypothetical ideal solution for our specific one-call-per-hour example. Instead of keeping a warm instance for a fixed period after each invocation, an efficient policy would shut down the instance immediately after each execution. Then, it would boot a new instance right before the next invocation is about to come in.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row no-gutter">
    <div class="col-lg-1 pl-0"></div>
    <div class="col-sm-11">
        
<figure >
    
        <img src="prewarming.png"
            alt="A new instance is pre-warmed right before the request comes in and recycled immediately after the execution is complete"
             />

    <div class="col-lg-2 pl-0"></div>
    <div class="col-lg-9 flex-first flex-lg-unordered">
        <div class="article-post">

<p>This solves both problems above. Now, all requests are served quickly because Azure creates a fresh instance <em>before</em> a request comes in. Also, Azure saves resources because it can pre-warm the instance shortly before each request and shut it down immediately after the invocation is completed.</p>

<p>This ideal case only works in the world of perfect information. Of course, Azure can&rsquo;t perfectly predict the future and spin up a new instance right before the next HTTP request. Instead, it would need to learn the workload and try to predict the next invocation probabilistically. That&rsquo;s the essence of the policy that the authors of &ldquo;Serverless in the Wild&rdquo; suggest.</p>

<p>Predicting arbitrary workloads can be pretty hard. Every application is unique, and invocations are caused by external events like human behavior or actions in business processes.</p>

<p>Also, there are limits to resources that a prediction policy may consume. The policy calculation should be efficient and not have a significant impact on the system&rsquo;s overall performance. A practical policy would have low overhead both in terms of the size of data structures and the CPU usage overhead.</p>

<h2 id="proposed-policy">Proposed Policy</h2>

<p>The paper suggests a practical policy that tries to predict future invocations without being too expensive.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start at the point when a new application has just been deployed. Azure knows nothing about its invocation patterns yet. The new policy would default to the traditional fixed &ldquo;keep-alive&rdquo; interval but would keep an instance running for a generous 4 hours. Simultaneously, it starts learning the workload.</p>

<p>Every time a new request comes in, the policy calculates how many minutes passed since the end of the previous invocation and records this value in a histogram. The histogram&rsquo;s bins have one-minute granularity. So, in my example, if an invocation came 60 minutes after the previous one, the value for the bin <code>60</code> will increase by one.</p>

<p>At some point, the policy would decide that it knows enough to start predicting future invocations. The histogram for my application may look like this:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row no-gutter">
    <div class="col-lg-1 pl-0"></div>
    <div class="col-sm-11">
        
<figure >
    
        <img src="histogram.png"
            alt="Every column shows how many requests landed on minute X after a previous execution"
             />

    <div class="col-lg-2 pl-0"></div>
    <div class="col-lg-9 flex-first flex-lg-unordered">
        <div class="article-post">

<p>The new adaptive policy kicks in. Now, it shuts down the active instance after each request, because it knows that the next invocation is unlikely to come any time soon. Then, it uses two cut-off points to plan the warming strategy:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>head cut-off</strong> point is when a new warm instance should be ready. Calculated as 5th percentile minus 10% margin. Approximately 53 minutes in my example.</li>
<li>The <strong>tail cut-off</strong> point is when to kill the warm instance if no request comes in. Calculated as 95th percentile plus 10% margin. Approximately 67 minutes in my example.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="col-lg-9 flex-first flex-lg-unordered">
        <div class="article-post">

<p>Because my specific workload is highly predictable, it would enjoy the absence of cold starts. Would the policy work for other scenarios?</p>

<h2 id="scenarios">Scenarios</h2>

<p>The suggested policy makes sense for the example we considered so far. However, real-life workloads are very diverse. Let&rsquo;s try to generalize and consider several possible scenarios and how the policy handles them.</p>

<h4 id="regular-cadence">Regular cadence</h4>

<p>Consistent intervals between invocations are the ideal match for the suggested policy. If a histogram is well-shaped and relatively narrow, both head and tail cut-offs are easy to identify. These distributions produce the ideal situation: long shutdown periods and short keep-alive windows.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-9 flex-first flex-lg-unordered">
        <div class="article-post">

<p>My example above falls into this category.</p>

<h4 id="frequent-invocations">Frequent invocations</h4>

<p>Many applications would invoke functions frequently, so, many measured intervals would be close to zero.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row no-gutter">
    <div class="col-lg-1 pl-0"></div>
    <div class="col-sm-11">
        
<figure >
    
        <img src="frequent.png"
            alt="In this case, instances are not unloaded after a request is executed and wait for another one, or the tail cut-off moment"

    <div class="col-lg-2 pl-0"></div>
    <div class="col-lg-9 flex-first flex-lg-unordered">
        <div class="article-post">

<p>In these cases, the head cut-off is rounded down to zero. The policy does not shut down the application after a function execution but keeps it alive until the next execution, or until the tail cut-off.</p>

<h4 id="inconsistent-invocations-or-not-enough-data">Inconsistent invocations or not enough data</h4>

<p>The policy needs a certain amount of quality data to start being useful in predicting the next invocation.
The application may be recently deployed and may not have enough points yet:</p>

<p>Alternatively, data points might not come in a well-shaped cluster:</p>

        <div class="article-post">

<p>In both of these cases, the policy reverts to a default approach: no shutdown and a long keep-alive window. This puts an extra burden on the cloud provider, but the idea is that these scenarios would be rare enough to allow the policy to stay practical.</p>

<h4 id="invocations-beyond-4-hours">Invocations beyond 4 hours</h4>

<p>The policy defines a maximum value for histogram data to limit the storage capacity for the histogram. The paper suggests a maximum of 4 hours. All intervals beyond that threshold are recorded in a special overflow bin.</p>

<p>If a lot of values start to fall into that range, the bin-based policy can&rsquo;t perform well anymore. For this category of applications, the paper suggests switching to time-series analysis to predict the next interval duration. They mention the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average">autoregressive integrated moving average</a> model without providing many details.</p>

<p>As invocations of this type are infrequent, the overall overhead of such a model would stay relatively low.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

<p>The authors evaluated the policy based on recorded <a href="/2020/05/serverless-in-the-wild-azure-functions-usage-stats">production usage statistics</a>. The evaluation consists of two parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>A simulation that iterates through the data, calculates the policy models, and evaluates whether each invocation would yield a cold starts with the new policy.</li>
<li>A replay of the recorded invocation trace on a modified version of Apache OpenWhisk, an open-source FaaS platform. The controller was modified to use the new policy while managing workers. The trace was scaled down by randomly selecting applications with mid-range popularity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both parts showed similarly promising results of reducing the cold start frequency and resource waste. The new policy reduced the average and 99-percentile function execution time 33% and 82%, respectively, while also reducing the average memory consumption of workers by 16%.</p>

<p>The overhead of the policy looks manageable too. The controller&rsquo;s policy implementation adds less than 1 ms to the end-to-end latency and only a 5% increase in controller&rsquo;s CPU utilization.</p>

<p>By tuning the parameters of the policy (default window, cut-off points, granularity), its implementation can achieve the same number of cold starts at much lower resource cost, or keep the same resource cost but reduce the frequency of cold starts significantly.</p>

<h2 id="production-implementation">Production Implementation</h2>

<p>Encouraged by the position evaluation, the team implemented the policy in Azure Functions for HTTP-triggered applications, it will be rolling out to production in stages starting this month (June 2020).</p>

<p>Here are some implementation details:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each histogram contains data for 4 hours, filling up 960 bytes per application.</li>
<li>The histogram is stored in memory and backed up to a database once per hour.</li>
<li>A new histogram is started every day with a history of previous values stored for two weeks.</li>
<li>Worker warming is scheduled for the calculated head cut-off point minus 90 seconds.</li>
<li>Pre-warming loads function dependencies and performs JIT where possible.</li>
<li>All policy decisions are asynchronous, off the critical path to minimize the latency impact on the invocation.</li>
</ul>

<p>I look forward to testing this new policy once it&rsquo;s rolled out. Expect a follow-up blog post!</p>

<h2 id="open-questions">Open Questions</h2>

<p>Everything above is my summary of the &ldquo;Serverless in the Wild&rdquo; paper&rsquo;s ideas and findings. I want to close the blog post with some questions that I still have, personally.</p>

<p>Whether true in practice or not, the public opinion strongly perceives cold starts as a notable obstacle to serverless adoption. It&rsquo;s great to see some concrete suggestions driven by data that may improve cold starts in serverless functions.</p>

<p>The sweet spot of the suggested policy is applications with relatively regular intervals between invocations below several hours. I think the practical effect of the strategy might still be limited. Here are some concerns that I see.</p>

<p><em>The authors reviewed my questions and provided their answers, which I&rsquo;m including in the text below.</em></p>

<h4 id="who-benefits">Who benefits?</h4>

<p>Not every serverless function is sensitive to cold starts.</p>

<p>The policy favors functions with predictable intervals. Timer-based schedules (whether functions with timer trigger or external timers sending requests to the app or IoT devices communicating periodically) may produce perfect histograms. And yet, those functions are not damaged by a cold start and may entirely live with it.</p>

<p>On the other side, human-initiated requests that care about cold starts are likely to be less predictable. Does it mean they don&rsquo;t enjoy much improvement with the new policy?</p>

<p>The Azure Functions team is rolling the policy out for HTTP functions, so they do expect it to be useful. We will know soon!</p>

<h5 id="response-from-the-authors">Response from the authors:</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a large fraction of the applications that will likely benefit. Because for many applications the keep-alive interval can drastically reduce, the provider can afford to increase the keep-alive for other applications. About 50% of the applications have average inter-invocation times of 30 minutes of more. These incur many cold starts in the fixed policy, and will likely see a reduction in cold starts because their keep-alive intervals will be able to grow. Applications with idle times longer than 4 hours can also benefit because of the ARIMA time-series prediction.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="is-it-flexible-enough">Is it flexible enough?</h4>

<p>The policy assumes that the interval distribution is stable over time. How will this hold in practice over more extended periods?</p>

<p>Imagine an application that is only used during business hours. Or, an application that is mostly idle but is sporadically applied for a specific business process. Or, a demo app that you want to show to your colleagues during a planning meeting. Likely, all of them would still hit cold starts at the beginning of a session.</p>

<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why the production implementation begins with a clean histogram every day. They will watch and learn, and may use data for the last two weeks to improve later on.</p>

<h5 id="response-from-the-authors-1">Response from the authors:</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The policy does not have to assume a stationary distribution of arrival patterns. In the traces analyzed in the paper there was not a significant enough variation in the distributions to enable a deep investigation. With the production deployment, we will investigate different policies to decay information from previous histograms.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="what-about-function-warming">What about function warming?</h4>

<p>There&rsquo;s the elephant in the room of cold starts: function &ldquo;warming&rdquo;. Warming is a trick when a developer adds an extra timer-based function to their Function App so that the timer triggers every few minutes. This way, the runtime would never unload it, and an instance would always be ready.</p>

<p>I suspect that this simple trick still outperforms the suggested histogram-based policy in terms of cold-start prevention. Obviously, it doesn&rsquo;t help the cloud provider to save costs.</p>

<p>Is there a way to combine two approaches and get the benefits of both?</p>

<h5 id="response-from-the-authors-2">Response from the authors:</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The results in the paper take into account user-generated warm-up functions that are present in the data. If the hybrid policy is successful in preventing cold starts, there will be no need for users to create periodic warm-up functions, which represent extra effort and higher costs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="what-about-the-scale-out-cold-start">What about the scale-out cold start?</h4>

<p>The paper focuses on applications that are invoked rarely. However, even applications with higher utilization may still hit cold starts when scaled out on multiple instances. Every new instance would need to boot, and the requests would still be waiting.</p>

<p>The suggested policy does not address cold starts beyond the first instance, even though they do occur and potentially have a more significant impact on latency percentiles of real-world human-facing applications.</p>

<h5 id="response-from-the-authors-3">Response from the authors:</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We didn’t address scale-out cold starts in the paper. We can pre-warm the scale-out instances by forcing the scale out to happen slightly before it normally would. For example, when the scale out is triggered by a threshold number of concurrent invocations, we can lower the threshold slightly. We will be experimenting with such techniques in our implementation in Azure Functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Despite several open questions above, I&rsquo;m delighted that the paper was published. I welcome any structured effort that focuses on cold start optimization. The paper highlights usage statistics, the challenges of the cold start problem, and suggests several improvements.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s even more exciting to see the finding being applied in Azure in production!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Developing infrastructure programs in C# with unit tests, TDD, and mocks</blockquote>

<p>Because Pulumi uses general-purpose programming languages to provision cloud resources, you can take advantage of native tools and perform automated tests of your infrastructure. The full power of each language is available, including access to libraries and frameworks for testing.</p>

<p>This blog post takes a deeper dive into mock-based unit testing of Pulumi programs written in C#. You can find an F# version of this blog post <a href="/2020/05/unit-testing-cloud-deployments-with-pulumi-in-fsharp/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-unit-testing-works-in-pulumi">How Unit Testing Works in Pulumi</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a picture showing how Pulumi components interact during a typical deployment process.</p>

<p><img src="./engine.png" alt="Pulumi Components Interaction" /></p>

<p>Whenever a new resource is instantiated in code, the program makes a remote call to the engine. The engine receives the resource&rsquo;s input values, validates them, and translates the request to an invocation of a cloud API. The API returns some data, which are translated to resource outputs and sent back to the program.</p>

<p>The remote calls may be slow, unreliable, and non-deterministic, which makes testing of these interactions hard.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/testing/">Pulumi testing guide</a> outlines several testing methods, but today I want to focus on unit testing.</p>

<p>The Pulumi SDK provides a hook to replace all the remote calls with mocks. Mocks run in the same process and can respond immediately with hard-coded or calculated on-the-fly data.</p>

<p><img src="./mocks.png" alt="Pulumi with Mocks" /></p>

<p>We can write fully deterministic and blazingly fast automated tests as all remote calls and uncertainty are eliminated. There is no cloud to respond to resource creation, so it&rsquo;s a developer&rsquo;s responsibility to mimic the cloud behavior with mocks adequately.</p>

<p>This blog post walks you through an example of unit testing and mocking with the .NET SDK.</p>

<h2 id="define-the-base-structure">Define the Base Structure</h2>

<p>In this article, I build a program that deploys a static website to Azure. I use TDD to add new tests and deployment components bit-by-bit.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with an empty project&mdash;go ahead and create a .NET Core Console Application with the .NET CLI or your favorite IDE.</p>

<h3 id="install-nuget-packages">Install NuGet packages</h3>

<p>You are free to choose your unit testing frameworks, mocking and assertions libraries. I&rsquo;m using NUnit with FluentAssertions, and my program tests Azure resources, so this is my project file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">&lt;Project Sdk=<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Microsoft.NET.Sdk&#34;</span>&gt;

  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;OutputType&gt;Exe&lt;/OutputType&gt;
    &lt;TargetFramework&gt;netcoreapp3.1&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
    &lt;Nullable&gt;enable&lt;/Nullable&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;

  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include=<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;FluentAssertions&#34;</span> Version=<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;5.10.2&#34;</span> /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include=<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk&#34;</span> Version=<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;16.5.0&#34;</span> /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include=<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;NUnit&#34;</span> Version=<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;3.12.0&#34;</span> /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include=<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;NUnit3TestAdapter&#34;</span> Version=<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;3.16.1&#34;</span> /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include=<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Pulumi.Azure&#34;</span> Version=<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;3.*&#34;</span> /&gt;
  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;

&lt;/Project&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="stack">Stack</h3>

<p>A Pulumi stack is the &ldquo;unit&rdquo; of our testing. Every test instantiates a stack, retrieves the resources that the stack defines, and makes assertions about them.</p>

<p>Here is my starting point in <code>WebsiteStack.cs</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#00f">using</span> System.IO;
<span style="color:#00f">using</span> Pulumi;
<span style="color:#00f">using</span> Pulumi.Azure.Core;
<span style="color:#00f">using</span> Storage = Pulumi.Azure.Storage;

<span style="color:#00f">public</span> <span style="color:#00f">class</span> <span style="color:#2b91af">WebsiteStack</span> : Stack
{
    <span style="color:#00f">public</span> WebsiteStack()
    {
        <span style="color:#008000">// &lt;-- Cloud resources go here
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>This class is precisely what Pulumi expects to start deploying your resources to the cloud. Once the test suite is ready and green, you can deploy the stack with <code>pulumi up</code>.</p>

<h3 id="mocks">Mocks</h3>

<p>As I explained above, unit tests replace the real Pulumi engine with mocks. Mocks get all calls and respond with predefined values.</p>

<p>A mock class has to implement two methods of <code>Pulumi.Testing.IMocks</code> interface. <code>NewResourceAsync</code> is called whenever a new resource is defined, while <code>CallAsync</code> is invoked when our program retrieves information about existing cloud resources. We&rsquo;ll focus on the former in this post, but we still need to define both.</p>

<p>While you are free to use your favorite mocking library, I&rsquo;ll keep it simple and define the mocks as a plain class.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#00f">using</span> System.Collections.Immutable;
<span style="color:#00f">using</span> System.Threading.Tasks;

<span style="color:#00f">namespace</span> UnitTesting
{
    <span style="color:#00f">class</span> <span style="color:#2b91af">Mocks</span> : IMocks
    {

            <span style="color:#2b91af">string</span> type, <span style="color:#2b91af">string</span> name, ImmutableDictionary&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af">string</span>, <span style="color:#2b91af">object</span>&gt; inputs, <span style="color:#2b91af">string?</span> provider, <span style="color:#2b91af">string?</span> id)
        {
            <span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> outputs = ImmutableDictionary.CreateBuilder&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af">string</span>, <span style="color:#2b91af">object</span>&gt;();

            <span style="color:#008000">// Forward all input parameters as resource outputs, so that we could test them.
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>            outputs.AddRange(inputs);

            <span style="color:#00f">return</span> Task.FromResult((id, (<span style="color:#2b91af">object</span>)outputs));
        }

        <span style="color:#00f">public</span> Task&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af">object</span>&gt; CallAsync(<span style="color:#2b91af">string</span> token, ImmutableDictionary&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af">string</span>, <span style="color:#2b91af">object</span>&gt; inputs, <span style="color:#2b91af">string?</span> provider)
        {
            <span style="color:#008000">// We don&#39;t use this method in this particular test suite.
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>            <span style="color:#008000">// Default to returning whatever we got as input.
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>            <span style="color:#00f">return</span> Task.FromResult((<span style="color:#2b91af">object</span>)inputs);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Both methods receive several parameters and need to return a result. Notably, they get the list of <code>inputs</code>&mdash;the arguments that our program defined for the given resource. The goal of the mocks is to return the list of outputs, similarly to what a cloud provider would do.</p>

<p>My default implementation returns the outputs that include all the inputs and nothing else. That&rsquo;s a sensible default: usually, real outputs are a superset of inputs. We&rsquo;ll extend this behavior as we need later on.</p>

<h3 id="test-fixture">Test Fixture</h3>

<p>The next class to add is the container for my future unit tests. I named the file <code>WebsiteStackTests.cs</code> and it defines a test container, called a &ldquo;test fixture&rdquo; in NUnit:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#00f">using</span> System.Linq;
<span style="color:#00f">using</span> System.Threading.Tasks;

<span style="color:#00f">using</span> Pulumi;
<span style="color:#00f">using</span> Pulumi.Azure.Core;
<span style="color:#00f">using</span> Storage = Pulumi.Azure.Storage;

<span style="color:#00f">namespace</span> UnitTesting
{
	[TestFixture]
	<span style="color:#00f">public</span> <span style="color:#00f">class</span> <span style="color:#2b91af">WebserverStackTests</span>
	{
        <span style="color:#008000">// &lt;-- Tests go here
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>
		<span style="color:#00f">private</span> <span style="color:#00f">static</span> Task&lt;ImmutableArray&lt;Resource&gt;&gt; TestAsync()
		{
			<span style="color:#00f">return</span> Deployment.TestAsync&lt;WebsiteStack&gt;(<span style="color:#00f">new</span> Mocks(), <span style="color:#00f">new</span> TestOptions {IsPreview = <span style="color:#00f">false</span>});
		}
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>I defined a helper method <code>TestAsync</code> that points Pulumi&rsquo;s <code>Deployment.TestAsync</code> to our stack and mock classes.</p>

<p>As we progress through the article, I will add tests to this class one-by-one.</p>

<h3 id="retrieve-output-values">Retrieve output values</h3>

<p>Finally, I need a small extension method to extract values from outputs. Every Pulumi resource returns values wrapped inside an <code>Output&lt;T&gt;</code> container. While the real engine runs, those values may be known or unknown, but my mock-based tests always return known values. It&rsquo;s safe to get those values and convert them to a <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#00f">public</span> <span style="color:#00f">static</span> <span style="color:#00f">class</span> <span style="color:#2b91af">TestingExtensions</span>
{
    <span style="color:#00f">public</span> <span style="color:#00f">static</span> Task&lt;T&gt; GetValueAsync&lt;T&gt;(<span style="color:#00f">this</span> Output&lt;T&gt; output)
    {
        <span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> tcs = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> TaskCompletionSource&lt;T&gt;();
        output.Apply(v =&gt; { tcs.SetResult(v); <span style="color:#00f">return</span> v; });
        <span style="color:#00f">return</span> tcs.Task;
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>To learn more about outputs, read <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/programming-model/#stack-outputs">this article</a>.</p>

<h2 id="first-test">First Test</h2>

<p>The setup is done, time to write my first unit test! True to the TDD spirit, I write the tests before I define any resources.</p>

<p>Every Azure resource has to live inside a resource group, so my first test checks that a new resource group is defined.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">[Test]
<span style="color:#00f">public</span> <span style="color:#00f">async</span> Task SingleResourceGroupExists()
{
    <span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> resources = <span style="color:#00f">await</span> TestAsync();

    <span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> resourceGroups = resources.OfType&lt;ResourceGroup&gt;().ToList();
    resourceGroups.Count.Should().Be(1, <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;a single resource group is expected&#34;</span>);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>This code is great to illustrate the overall structure of each test:</p>

<ol>
<li>Call the <code>TestAsync</code> method to evaluate the stack.</li>
<li>Find the target resource in the collection of created resources.</li>
<li>Assert a property of the target resource.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this case, the test validates that there is one and only one resource group defined.</p>

<p>I can run <code>dotnet test</code> and see the expected test failure:</p>

<pre><code>$ dotnet test
...

X SingleResourceGroupExists [238ms]
  Error Message:
   Expected resourceGroups.Count to be 1 because a single resource group is expected, but found 0.
...
Total tests: 1
     Failed: 1
 Total time: 0.9270 Seconds
</code></pre>

<p>I go ahead and add the following definition to the <code>WebsiteStack</code> constructor.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> resourceGroup = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> ResourceGroup(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;www-prod-rg&#34;</span>);
</code></pre></div>
<p>This change is enough to make the tests green!</p>

<pre><code>$ dotnet test
...
Test Run Successful.

<p>For billing and lifecycle management, I want all my resource groups to be tagged. Therefore, my second test validates that the resource group has an <code>Environment</code> tag on it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">[Test]
<span style="color:#00f">public</span> <span style="color:#00f">async</span> Task ResourceGroupHasEnvironmentTag()
{
    <span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> resources = <span style="color:#00f">await</span> TestAsync();
    <span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> resourceGroup = resources.OfType&lt;ResourceGroup&gt;().First();

    <span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> tags = <span style="color:#00f">await</span> resourceGroup.Tags.GetValueAsync();
    tags.Should().NotBeNull(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Tags must be defined&#34;</span>);
    tags.Should().ContainKey(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Environment&#34;</span>);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The test finds the resource group and then checks that the <code>Tags</code> dictionary is not null and contains a tag with the name <code>Environment</code>. Predictably, the test fails:</p>

<pre><code>$ dotnet test
...
  X ResourceGroupHasEnvironmentTag [240ms]
  Error Message:
   Expected tags not to be &lt;null&gt; because Tags must be defined.
...
Test Run Failed.
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I edit the stack class and change the resource group definition.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> resourceGroup = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> ResourceGroup(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;www-prod-rg&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#00f">new</span> ResourceGroupArgs
{
    Tags = { { <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Environment&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;production&#34;</span> } }
});
</code></pre></div>
<p>This change makes the test suite green again, and we are good to proceed.</p>

<h2 id="storage-account">Storage Account</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to add a test for a second resource in the stack: a Storage Account. To make things more interesting, I want to check that the storage account belongs to our resource group.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no direct link between a storage account object and a resource group object. Instead, we need to check the <code>ResourceGroupName</code> property of the account. The test below expects the account to belong to a resource group called <code>www-prod-rg</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">[Test]
<span style="color:#00f">public</span> <span style="color:#00f">async</span> Task StorageAccountBelongsToResourceGroup()
{
    <span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> resources = <span style="color:#00f">await</span> TestAsync();
    <span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> storageAccount = resources.OfType&lt;Storage.Account&gt;().SingleOrDefault();
    storageAccount.Should().NotBeNull(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Storage account not found&#34;</span>);

    <span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> resourceGroupName = <span style="color:#00f">await</span> storageAccount.ResourceGroupName.GetValueAsync();
    resourceGroupName.Should().Be(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;www-prod-rg&#34;</span>);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, the test fails. I try to fix it with what I think is the minimal change to make the test pass by adding a new resource to the stack and pointing it to the resource group.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> storageAccount = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> Storage.Account(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;wwwprodsa&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#00f">new</span> Storage.AccountArgs
{
    ResourceGroupName = resourceGroup.Name,
});
</code></pre></div>
<p>However, when I rerun the test suite, all three tests fail. They complain about the missing required properties <code>AccountReplicationType</code> and <code>AccountTier</code> on the storage account, so I have to add those.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> storageAccount = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> Storage.Account(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;wwwprodsa&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#00f">new</span> Storage.AccountArgs
{
    ResourceGroupName = resourceGroup.Name,
    AccountTier = <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Standard&#34;</span>,
    AccountReplicationType = <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;LRS&#34;</span>,
    StaticWebsite = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> Storage.Inputs.AccountStaticWebsiteArgs
    {
        IndexDocument = <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;index.html&#34;</span>
    }
});
</code></pre></div>
<p>I defined the <code>StaticWebsite</code> property as well: I&rsquo;ll leave testing these values as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>Two resource group tests are back to green again, but the storage account test fails with a new error message.</p>

<pre><code>X StorageAccountBelongsToResourceGroup [84ms]
  Error Message:
   Expected resourceGroupName to be &quot;www-prod-rg&quot;, but found &lt;null&gt;.
</code></pre>

<p>What&rsquo;s going on, and why is it <code>null</code>?</p>

<p>I defined the account name like this: <code>ResourceGroupName = resourceGroup.Name</code>. However, if we look closely, the <code>resourceGroup</code> resource doesn&rsquo;t have an input property <code>Name</code> defined. <code>www-prod-rg</code> is a logical name for Pulumi deployment, not the physical name of the resource.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, the Pulumi engine would use the logical name to produce the physical name of the resource group automatically (see <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/programming-model/#names">resource names</a> for details). However, my mocks don&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a good reason to change the <code>Mocks</code> implementation. I add the following lines to the <code>NewResourceAsync</code> method.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#008000">// Set the name to resource name if it&#39;s not set explicitly in inputs.
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span><span style="color:#00f">if</span> (!inputs.ContainsKey(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;name&#34;</span>))
    outputs.Add(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;name&#34;</span>, name);
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that mocks operate on weakly-typed dictionaries, so I need to get the property name right. Pulumi SDKs are open source, so I looked <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure/blob/1fdcab88065175ced768d900e7dcedf3b1d1b0a7/sdk/dotnet/Core/ResourceGroup.cs#L90">here</a> to double-check the exact value.</p>

<p>After this change in <code>Mocks</code>, my tests go green again.</p>

<pre><code>Test Run Successful.
Total tests: 3
     Passed: 3
</code></pre>

<h2 id="website-files">Website Files</h2>

<p>The next step is to upload some files to the static website. Well, instead, to write an automated test that validates the upload with mocks.</p>

<p>I create a <code>wwwroot</code> folder with two HTML files in it and copy the folder to the build&rsquo;s output. Here is my change in the project file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;None Update=<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;wwwroot\**\*.*&#34;</span>&gt;
        &lt;CopyToOutputDirectory&gt;PreserveNewest&lt;/CopyToOutputDirectory&gt;
    &lt;/None&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, the test is straightforward: it expects two <code>Blob</code> resources in the stack.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">[Test]
<span style="color:#00f">public</span> <span style="color:#00f">async</span> Task UploadsTwoFiles()
{
    <span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> resources = <span style="color:#00f">await</span> TestAsync();
    <span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> files = resources.OfType&lt;Storage.Blob&gt;().ToList();
    files.Count.Should().Be(2, <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Should have uploaded files from `wwwroot`&#34;</span>);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>As intended, the test fails immediately.</p>

<pre><code>X UploadsTwoFiles [95ms]
  Error Message:
   Expected files.Count to be 2 because Should have uploaded files from `wwwroot`, but found 0.
</code></pre>

<p>I extend my stack with the following loop that navigates through the files and creates a storage blob for each of them.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> files = Directory.GetFiles(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;wwwroot&#34;</span>);
<span style="color:#00f">foreach</span> (<span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> file <span style="color:#00f">in</span> files)
{
    <span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> blob = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> Storage.Blob(file, <span style="color:#00f">new</span> Storage.BlobArgs
    {
        ContentType = <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;application/html&#34;</span>,
        Source = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> FileAsset(file),
        StorageAccountName = storageAccount.Name,
        StorageContainerName = <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;$web&#34;</span>,
        Type = <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Block&#34;</span>
    });
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>However, this change breaks the stack and all tests in the suite:</p>

<pre><code>Error Message:
   Pulumi.RunException : Running program failed with an unhandled exception:
System.InvalidOperationException: Unsupported value when converting to protobuf: Pulumi.FileAsset
   at Pulumi.Serialization.Serializer.CreateValue(Object value)
...
</code></pre>

<p>Once again, our mocks fail to represent the behavior of the engine accurately. The Pulumi engine knows about the <code>FileAsset</code> class pointing to a file on the disk and how to convert it to an uploaded blob. But, the engine doesn&rsquo;t copy this property to outputs. I need to adjust the mocks again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly interested in testing the binary contents of the files now, so I&rsquo;ll change the <code>Mocks</code> class to ignore the <code>source</code> property and not to include it into the output dictionary.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#00f">if</span> (type == <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;azure:storage/blob:Blob&#34;</span>)

</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>    <span style="color:#008000">// We don&#39;t need them in the test, so blank out the property for now.
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>    outputs.Remove(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;source&#34;</span>);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>This change makes my test suite happy again.</p>

<pre><code>Test Run Successful.
Total tests: 4
     Passed: 4
</code></pre>

<h2 id="validate-website-url">Validate Website URL</h2>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve been validating the input parameters of resources. What if I want to test something that is usually done by the cloud provider?</p>

<p>For instance, when Azure creates a static website, it automatically assigns a public endpoint. The endpoint is then available in the <code>PrimaryWebEndpoint</code> property after the Pulumi program ran and resources are created. I may want to export this value from stack outputs and validate it in a unit test.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">[Test]
<span style="color:#00f">public</span> <span style="color:#00f">async</span> Task StackExportsWebsiteUrl()

<p>This test doesn&rsquo;t even compile yet, so I have to define the <code>Endpoint</code> property and assign a value to it. Here is the complete implementation of the stack with the output property defined at the end.</p>

<p>Note that it still takes less than a second to run my test suite so that I can iterate very quickly.</p>

<h2 id="get-started">Get Started</h2>

<p>The tests above cover the basics of unit testing with Pulumi .NET SDK. You can take it from here and apply the techniques and practices that you use while testing the application code. You may also try more advanced practices like property-based testing or behavior-driven development&mdash;we believe that the mocks enable many testing styles.</p>

<p>Because Pulumi uses general-purpose programming languages to provision cloud resources, you can take advantage of native tools and perform automated tests of your infrastructure. The full power of each language is available, including access to libraries and frameworks for testing.</p>

<p>This blog post takes a deeper dive into mock-based unit testing of Pulumi programs written in F#. You can find a C# version of this blog post <a href="/2020/05/unit-testing-cloud-deployments-with-pulumi-in-csharp/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-unit-testing-works-in-pulumi">How Unit Testing Works in Pulumi</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a picture showing how Pulumi components interact during a typical deployment process.</p>

<p><img src="./engine.png" alt="Pulumi Components Interaction" /></p>

<p>Whenever a new resource is instantiated in code, the program makes a remote call to the engine. The engine receives the resource&rsquo;s input values, validates them, and translates the request to an invocation of a cloud API. The API returns some data, which are translated to resource outputs and sent back to the program.</p>

<p>The remote calls may be slow, unreliable, and non-deterministic, which makes testing of these interactions hard.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/testing/">testing guide</a> outlines several testing methods, but today I want to focus on unit testing.</p>

<p>The Pulumi SDK provides a hook to replace all the remote calls with mocks. Mocks run in the same process and can respond immediately with hard-coded or calculated on-the-fly data.</p>

<p><img src="./mocks.png" alt="Pulumi with Mocks" /></p>

<p>We can write fully deterministic and blazingly fast automated tests as all remote calls and uncertainty are eliminated. There is no cloud to respond to resource creation, so it&rsquo;s a developer&rsquo;s responsibility to mimic the cloud behavior with mocks adequately.</p>

<p>This blog post walks you through an example of unit testing and mocking with the .NET SDK.</p>

<h2 id="define-the-base-structure">Define the Base Structure</h2>

<p>In this article, I build a program that deploys a static website to Azure. I use TDD to add new tests and deployment components bit-by-bit.</p>

    &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;

&lt;/Project&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="stack">Stack</h3>

<p>A Pulumi stack is the &ldquo;unit&rdquo; of our testing. Every test instantiates a stack, retrieves the resources that the stack defines, and makes assertions about them.</p>

<p>Here is my starting point in <code>WebsiteStack.fs</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">namespace</span> UnitTesting

<span style="color:#00f">open</span> Pulumi
<span style="color:#00f">open</span> Pulumi.FSharp
<span style="color:#00f">open</span> Pulumi.Azure.Core

<span style="color:#00f">type</span> <span style="color:#2b91af">WebsiteStack</span>() =
    <span style="color:#00f">inherit</span> Stack()

    // &lt;-- Cloud resources go here</code></pre></div>
<p>This class is precisely what Pulumi expects to start deploying your resources to the cloud. Once the test suite is ready and green, you can deploy the stack with <code>pulumi up</code>.</p>

<h3 id="mocks">Mocks</h3>

<p>As I explained above, unit tests replace the real Pulumi engine with mocks. Mocks get all calls and respond with predefined values.</p>

<p>A mock class has to implement two methods of <code>Pulumi.Testing.IMocks</code> interface. <code>NewResourceAsync</code> is called whenever a new resource is defined, while <code>CallAsync</code> is invoked when our program retrieves information about existing cloud resources. We&rsquo;ll focus on the former in this post, but we still need to define both.</p>

<p>While you are free to use your favorite mocking library, I&rsquo;ll keep it simple and define the mocks as a plain class.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">namespace</span> UnitTesting

<p>Both methods receive several parameters and need to return a result. Notably, they get the list of <code>inputs</code>&mdash;the arguments that our program defined for the given resource. The goal of the mocks is to return the list of outputs, similarly to what a cloud provider would do.</p>

<p>My default implementation returns the outputs that include all the inputs and nothing else. That&rsquo;s a sensible default: usually, real outputs are a superset of inputs. We&rsquo;ll extend this behavior as we need later on.</p>

<h3 id="test-fixture">Test Fixture</h3>

<p>The next class to add is the container for my future unit tests. I named the file <code>WebsiteStackTests.fs</code> and it defines a test container, called a &ldquo;test fixture&rdquo; in NUnit:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">namespace</span> UnitTesting

[&lt;TestFixture&gt;]
<span style="color:#00f">type</span> <span style="color:#2b91af">WebserverStackTests</span>() =
    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> runTest(): ImmutableArray&lt;Resource&gt; =
        <span style="color:#00f">let</span> options = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> TestOptions(IsPreview = Nullable&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af">bool</span>&gt; <span style="color:#00f">false</span>)
        Deployment.TestAsync&lt;WebsiteStack&gt;(<span style="color:#00f">new</span> Mocks(), options)
        |&gt; Async.AwaitTask
        |&gt; Async.RunSynchronously

    // &lt;-- Tests go here</code></pre></div>
<p>I defined a helper method <code>TestAsync</code> that points Pulumi&rsquo;s <code>Deployment.TestAsync</code> to our stack and mock classes.</p>

<p>As we progress through the article, I will add tests to this class one-by-one.</p>

<h3 id="retrieve-output-values">Retrieve output values</h3>

<p>Finally, I need a small extension method to extract values from outputs. Every Pulumi resource returns values wrapped inside an <code>Output&lt;T&gt;</code> container. While the real engine runs, those values may be known or unknown, but my mock-based tests always return known values. It&rsquo;s safe to get those values and convert them to a <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">let</span> getValue(output: Output&lt;<span style="color:#00f">&#39;</span>a&gt;): <span style="color:#00f">&#39;</span>a =
    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> tcs = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> TaskCompletionSource&lt;<span style="color:#00f">&#39;</span>a&gt;()
    output.Apply(<span style="color:#00f">fun</span> v -&gt; tcs.SetResult(v); v) |&gt; ignore
    tcs.Task.Result</code></pre></div>
<p>To learn more about outputs, read <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/programming-model/#stack-outputs">this article</a>.</p>

<h2 id="first-test">First Test</h2>

<p>The setup is done, time to write my first unit test! True to the TDD spirit, I write the tests before I define any resources.</p>

<p>Every Azure resource has to live inside a resource group, so my first test checks that a new resource group is defined.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp">[&lt;Test&gt;]
<span style="color:#00f">member</span> this.SingleResourceGroupExists() =
    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> resources = runTest()

    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> resourceGroupCount = resources.OfType&lt;ResourceGroup&gt;() |&gt; Seq.length
    resourceGroupCount.Should().Be(1, <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;a single resource group is expected&#34;</span>) |&gt; ignore</code></pre></div>
<p>This code is great to illustrate the overall structure of each test:</p>

<ol>
<li>Call the <code>TestAsync</code> method to evaluate the stack.</li>
<li>Find the target resource in the collection of created resources.</li>
<li>Assert a property of the target resource.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this case, the test validates that there is one and only one resource group defined.</p>

<p>I can run <code>dotnet test</code> and see the expected test failure:</p>

<pre><code>$ dotnet test
...

X SingleResourceGroupExists [238ms]
  Error Message:
   Expected resourceGroups.Count to be 1 because a single resource group is expected, but found 0.
...
Total tests: 1
     Failed: 1
 Total time: 0.9270 Seconds
</code></pre>

<p>I go ahead and add the following definition to the <code>WebsiteStack</code> constructor.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">let</span> resourceGroup = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> ResourceGroup(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;www-prod-rg&#34;</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>This change is enough to make the tests green!</p>

<pre><code>$ dotnet test
...
Test Run Successful.
Total tests: 1
     Passed: 1
 Total time: 0.8462 Seconds
</code></pre>

<h2 id="tags">Tags</h2>

<p>For billing and lifecycle management, I want all my resource groups to be tagged. Therefore, my second test validates that the resource group has an <code>Environment</code> tag on it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp">[&lt;Test&gt;]
<span style="color:#00f">member</span> this.ResourceGroupHasEnvironmentTag() =
    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> resources = runTest()
    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> resourceGroup = resources.OfType&lt;ResourceGroup&gt;() |&gt; Seq.head

    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> tags = getValue resourceGroup.Tags
    tags.Should().NotBeNull(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Tags must be defined&#34;</span>) |&gt; ignore
    tags.Should().ContainKey(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Environment&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#00f">null</span>) |&gt; ignore</code></pre></div>
<p>The test finds the resource group and then checks that the <code>Tags</code> dictionary is not null and contains a tag with the name <code>Environment</code>. Predictably, the test fails:</p>

<pre><code>$ dotnet test
...
  X ResourceGroupHasEnvironmentTag [240ms]
  Error Message:
   Expected tags not to be &lt;null&gt; because Tags must be defined.
...
Test Run Failed.
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I edit the stack class and change the resource group definition.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">let</span> resourceGroup =
    <span style="color:#00f">new</span> ResourceGroup(
        <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;www-prod-rg&#34;</span>,
        <span style="color:#00f">new</span> ResourceGroupArgs(Tags = inputMap([<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Environment&#34;</span>, input <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;production&#34;</span>])))</code></pre></div>
<p>This change makes the test suite green again, and we are good to proceed.</p>

<h2 id="storage-account">Storage Account</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to add a test for a second resource in the stack: a Storage Account. To make things more interesting, I want to check that the storage account belongs to our resource group.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no direct link between a storage account object and a resource group object. Instead, we need to check the <code>ResourceGroupName</code> property of the account. The test below expects the account to belong to a resource group called <code>www-prod-rg</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp">[&lt;Test&gt;]
<span style="color:#00f">member</span> this.StorageAccountBelongsToResourceGroup() =
    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> resources = runTest()
    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> storageAccount = resources.OfType&lt;Account&gt;() |&gt; Seq.tryHead |&gt; Option.toObj
    storageAccount.Should().NotBeNull(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Storage account not found&#34;</span>) |&gt; ignore

    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> resourceGroupName = getValue storageAccount.ResourceGroupName
    resourceGroupName.Should().Be(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;www-prod-rg&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#00f">null</span>) |&gt; ignore</code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, the test fails. I try to fix it with what I think is the minimal change to make the test pass by adding a new resource to the stack and pointing it to the resource group.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">let</span> storageAccount =
    <span style="color:#00f">new</span> Account(
        <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;wwwprodsa&#34;</span>,
        <span style="color:#00f">new</span> AccountArgs(ResourceGroupName = io resourceGroup.Name))</code></pre></div>
<p>However, when I rerun the test suite, all three tests fail. They complain about the missing required properties <code>AccountReplicationType</code> and <code>AccountTier</code> on the storage account, so I have to add those.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">let</span> storageAccount =
    <span style="color:#00f">new</span> Account(
        <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;wwwprodsa&#34;</span>,
        <span style="color:#00f">new</span> AccountArgs(
            ResourceGroupName = io resourceGroup.Name,
            AccountTier = input <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Standard&#34;</span>,
            AccountReplicationType = input <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;LRS&#34;</span>,
            StaticWebsite = input (<span style="color:#00f">new</span> AccountStaticWebsiteArgs(IndexDocument = input <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;index.html&#34;</span>))))</code></pre></div>
<p>I defined the <code>StaticWebsite</code> property as well: I&rsquo;ll leave testing these values as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>Two resource group tests are back to green again, but the storage account test fails with a new error message.</p>

<pre><code>X StorageAccountBelongsToResourceGroup [84ms]
  Error Message:
   Expected resourceGroupName to be &quot;www-prod-rg&quot;, but found &lt;null&gt;.
</code></pre>

<p>What&rsquo;s going on, and why is it <code>null</code>?</p>

<p>I defined the account name like this: <code>ResourceGroupName = resourceGroup.Name</code>. However, if we look closely, the <code>resourceGroup</code> resource doesn&rsquo;t have an input property <code>Name</code> defined. <code>www-prod-rg</code> is a logical name for Pulumi deployment, not the physical name of the resource.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, the Pulumi engine would use the logical name to produce the physical name of the resource group automatically (see <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/programming-model/#names">resource names</a> for details). However, my mocks don&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a good reason to change the <code>Mocks</code> implementation. I add the following lines to the <code>NewResourceAsync</code> method.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">let</span> inputKVs = inputs |&gt; Seq.map(<span style="color:#00f">fun</span> kv -&gt; kv.Key, kv.Value) |&gt; Seq.toList
<span style="color:#00f">let</span> nameKVs = <span style="color:#00f">if</span> inputs.ContainsKey(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;name&#34;</span>) <span style="color:#00f">then</span> [] <span style="color:#00f">else</span> [(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;name&#34;</span>, name :&gt; <span style="color:#2b91af">obj</span>)]

<span style="color:#00f">let</span> outputs = [inputKVs; nameKVs] |&gt; Seq.concat |&gt; Seq.map KeyValuePair
<span style="color:#00f">let</span> dict = outputs.ToImmutableDictionary() :&gt; <span style="color:#2b91af">obj</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that mocks operate on weakly-typed dictionaries, so I need to get the property name right. Pulumi SDKs are open source, so I looked <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure/blob/1fdcab88065175ced768d900e7dcedf3b1d1b0a7/sdk/dotnet/Core/ResourceGroup.cs#L90">here</a> to double-check the exact value.</p>

<p>After this change in <code>Mocks</code>, my tests go green again.</p>

<pre><code>Test Run Successful.
Total tests: 3
     Passed: 3
</code></pre>

<h2 id="website-files">Website Files</h2>

<p>The next step is to upload some files to the static website. Well, instead, to write an automated test that validates the upload with mocks.</p>

<p>I create a <code>wwwroot</code> folder with two HTML files in it and copy the folder to the build&rsquo;s output. Here is my change in the project file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;None Update=<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;wwwroot\**\*.*&#34;</span>&gt;
        &lt;CopyToOutputDirectory&gt;PreserveNewest&lt;/CopyToOutputDirectory&gt;
    &lt;/None&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, the test is straightforward: it expects two <code>Blob</code> resources in the stack.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp">[&lt;Test&gt;]
<span style="color:#00f">member</span> this.UploadsTwoFiles() =
    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> resources = runTest()
    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> filesCount = resources.OfType&lt;Blob&gt;() |&gt; Seq.length
    filesCount.Should().Be(2, <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Should have uploaded files from `wwwroot`&#34;</span>) |&gt; ignore</code></pre></div>
<p>As intended, the test fails immediately.</p>

<pre><code>X UploadsTwoFiles [95ms]
  Error Message:
   Expected files.Count to be 2 because Should have uploaded files from `wwwroot`, but found 0.
</code></pre>

<p>I extend my stack with the following loop that navigates through the files and creates a storage blob for each of them.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">let</span> files =
    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> fileNames = Directory.GetFiles(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;wwwroot&#34;</span>)
    fileNames
    |&gt; Seq.map(<span style="color:#00f">fun</span> file -&gt;
        <span style="color:#00f">new</span> Blob(
            file,
            <span style="color:#00f">new</span> BlobArgs(
                ContentType = input <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;application/html&#34;</span>,
                Source = input (<span style="color:#00f">new</span> FileAsset(file) :&gt; AssetOrArchive),
                StorageAccountName = io storageAccount.Name,
                StorageContainerName = input <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;$web&#34;</span>,
                Type = input <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Block&#34;</span>)))
    |&gt; List.ofSeq</code></pre></div>
<p>However, this change breaks the stack and all tests in the suite:</p>

<pre><code>Error Message:
   Pulumi.RunException : Running program failed with an unhandled exception:
System.InvalidOperationException: Unsupported value when converting to protobuf: Pulumi.FileAsset
   at Pulumi.Serialization.Serializer.CreateValue(Object value)
...
</code></pre>

<p>Once again, our mocks fail to represent the behavior of the engine accurately. The Pulumi engine knows about the <code>FileAsset</code> class pointing to a file on the disk and how to convert it to an uploaded blob. But, the engine doesn&rsquo;t copy this property to outputs. I need to adjust the mocks again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly interested in testing the binary contents of the files now, so I&rsquo;ll change the <code>Mocks</code> class to ignore the <code>source</code> property and not to include it into the output dictionary.</p>

<h2 id="validate-website-url">Validate Website URL</h2>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve been validating the input parameters of resources. What if I want to test something that is usually done by the cloud provider?</p>

<p>For instance, when Azure creates a static website, it automatically assigns a public endpoint. The endpoint is then available in the <code>PrimaryWebEndpoint</code> property after the Pulumi program ran and resources are created. I may want to export this value from stack outputs and validate it in a unit test.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp">[&lt;Test&gt;]

<p>Note that it still takes less than a second to run my test suite so that I can iterate very quickly.</p>

<h2 id="get-started">Get Started</h2>

<p>The tests above cover the basics of unit testing with Pulumi .NET SDK. You can take it from here and apply the techniques and practices that you use while testing the application code. You may also try more advanced practices like property-based testing or behavior-driven development&mdash;we believe that the mocks enable many testing styles.</p>

<p>Here are several useful pointers to get started with testing in Pulumi:</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Insightful statistics about the actual production usage of Azure Functions, based on the data from Microsoft&rsquo;s paper</blockquote><p>Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Research <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03423.pdf">released</a> a paper called &quot;Serverless in the Wild: Characterizing and Optimizing the Serverless Workload at a Large Cloud Provider&quot;. In part 1 of the paper, they revealed some insightful statistics about the actual production usage of Azure Functions for two weeks in summer 2019.</p>

<p>This blog post is my summary and highlights of the most intriguing data points. I'll cover part 2 of the paper, focusing on cold starts, in a separate installment.</p>

<h2 id="trigger-types-and-invocations">Trigger Types and Invocations</h2>

<p>Every Azure Function has a trigger: it's linked to a specific event source, and every event in that source causes the Function to execute. Event sources include HTTP endpoints, timers, message queues, topics, event logs, and others. Which triggers are used more often?</p>

<p>The paper doesn't have a precise breakdown by specific sources like Service Bus or Event Grid, but it gives relative numbers per event category. It also shows the percentage of Function invocations that each type is responsible for.</p>

<p>Here is the comparison table:</p>

<table class="pure-table table table-striped">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Trigger type</th>
<th>% of Functions</th>
<th>% of Invocations</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>HTTP</td>
<td>55%</td>
<td>36%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Queue</td>
<td>15%</td>
<td>34%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Event</td>
<td>2%</td>
<td>25%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Timer</td>
<td>16%</td>
<td>2%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Orchestration</td>
<td>7%</td>
<td>2%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Others</td>
<td>5%</td>
<td>1%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Notable facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>More than half of Functions are triggered by HTTP.</li>
<li>Asynchronous queue and, especially, event functions have much more invocations on average than any other Function type.</li>
<li>The opposite is accurate for timer Functions: a relatively high number of Functions translates to a fraction of invocations.</li>
<li>Durable functions are quite popular if that's what the authors mean by &quot;orchestration&quot; triggers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="functions-and-applications">Functions and Applications</h2>

<p>Function App is the deployment unit of Azure Functions. Each Function App may contain one or more Functions packaged together. How often do people use multiple Functions, and what for?</p>

<table class="pure-table table table-striped">

</table>

<p>Apparently, multi-function applications are widespread! The number of functions-per-app is all over the spectrum, with some wild usage scenarios of hundreds or even thousands of Functions in the same Function App.</p>

<p>Combining this with trigger types, it seems hard to derive any common patterns of trigger combinations in the same app. The paper lists several common ones, but none of them has more than 5% of usage. For instance, only 4.5% of applications are exactly one HTTP trigger and one timer trigger&mdash;which I could potentially attribute to the pattern of warming HTTP Functions against <a href="/serverless/coldstarts">cold starts</a>.</p>

<h2 id="invocation-patterns">Invocation Patterns</h2>

<p>How often are functions invoked? What are typical numbers for executions per day, minute, or second?</p>

<p>The variation in invocation frequency is tremendous. While many Functions may stay idle for days, others run many times per second. There's nothing unexpected here: it's free to create a Function App, so many apps exist for test purposes, one-off experiments, or to handle infrequent timers or automation tasks. At the same time, some production Functions would serve intensive workloads via HTTP, queues, or event buses.</p>

<p>The paper shows actual numbers for frequency distribution:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>45%</strong> of Function Apps are invoked at most <strong>once per hour</strong>.</li>
<li>Another <strong>36%</strong> are invoked at most <strong>once per minute</strong>.</li>
<li>The remaining <strong>19%</strong> of more frequently invoked Functions represent more than 99.5% of all invocations.</li>
<li>Only about <strong>3%</strong> of applications are invoked more often than <strong>once a second</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm surprised that the vast majority of Functions run, on average, very infrequently. It looks like more than 97% of Function Apps don't require any scalability beyond scaling from zero to a single instance and back.</p>

<p>The following chart shows the cumulative number of invocations that Azure Functions handle across all applications. Unfortunately, there are no absolute numbers&mdash;the chart is normalized to the peak.</p>

<figure >
    
        <img src="invocations.png"
            alt="Total invocations per hour for all Azure Functions, relative to the peak"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Total invocations per hour for all Azure Functions, relative to the peak</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>There are apparent repeatable patterns and a constant baseline of roughly 50% of the invocations. The platform needs to handle about 2x scalability through a given day.</p>

<p>Overall, the macro-scalability of the platform seems to be less of a challenge compared to optimizing the lifecycle of each individual Function App. Across applications, the number of invocations per day varies by 8 orders of magnitude, making the resources the provider has to dedicate to each application also highly variable.</p>

<p>Since the majority of applications are mostly idle, any inefficiency in handling them, being significant relative to their total execution (billable) time, can be prohibitively expensive. And that's a hard problem to solve!</p>

<h2 id="function-execution-times">Function Execution Times</h2>

<p>Once a Function is triggered, for how long will it typically run until completed?</p>

<p>Predictably, executions in Function-as-a-Service are very short compared to other cloud workloads. However, again, there are several orders of magnitude difference across different Functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>About <strong>20%</strong> of Functions would complete, on average, in less than <strong>100 ms</strong>.</li>
<li>Approximately <strong>50%</strong> of the Functions execute for less than <strong>1 second</strong> on average.</li>
<li>Also, <strong>50%</strong> of the Functions have <strong>maximum</strong> execution time shorter than <strong>3 seconds</strong>.</li>
<li>Yet, the slowest <strong>10%</strong> of the Functions have maximum execution time more than <strong>1 minute</strong>, and <strong>4% take more than a minute on average</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The most common durations seem to be between 100 ms and several seconds, which is not surprising.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It's incredible how much of a variation exists in real-world workloads running in Azure Functions. Across all the metrics above, there never seem to be one or two dominating scenarios. It's impressive that a single service can decently handle all the variability.</p>

<p>Kudos to folks at Microsoft Azure for releasing the data and analysis for their actual production workloads, albeit just for two weeks and without absolute numbers.</p>

<p>The second part of the paper uses this data to analyze potential improvements in cold starts of Azure Functions. And that's an excellent topic for a follow-up blog post, so stay tuned!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>My review of the paper &ldquo;InfiniCache: Exploiting Ephemeral Serverless Functions to Build a Cost-Effective Memory Cache&rdquo;</blockquote><p>&ldquo;InfiniCache: Exploiting Ephemeral Serverless Functions to Build a Cost-Effective Memory Cache&rdquo; by Ao Wang, et al. (<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast20/presentation/wang-ao">link</a>) is a recently published paper which describes a prototype of a serverless distributed caching system sitting atop AWS Lambda.</p>
<p>While reading through the paper, I got fascinated by several techniques that they employed while implementing the system. Therefore, I decided to review the paper and highlight its most intriguing parts. I target my review at software and IT engineers working on cloud applications. I assume the reader has a basic understanding of serverless cloud functions (Function-as-a-Service, FaaS) and their traditional use cases.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a problem that InfiniCache aims to solve.</p>
<h2 id="i-state-in-stateless-functions">I. State in Stateless Functions</h2>
<p>Serverless functions excel at running stateless workloads. FaaS services use ephemeral compute instances to grow and shrink the capacity to adjust to a variable request rate. New virtual machines or containers are assigned and recycled by the cloud provider at arbitrary moments.</p>
<p>Functions are incredibly compelling for low-load usage scenarios, among others. Executions are charged per actual duration, at 100 ms granularity. If your application only needs to run several times per day in a test environment, it costs you literally zero.</p>
<p>Cloud providers try to reuse compute instances for multiple subsequent requests. The price of bootstrapping new instances is too high to pay for every request. A warm instance would keep pre-loaded files in memory between requests to minimize the overhead and <a href="/serverless/coldstarts">cold start</a> duration.</p>
<p>There seems to be a fundamental opportunity to exploit the keep-warm behavior further. Each function instance has up to several gigabytes of memory, while our executable cache might only consume several megabytes. Can we use this memory to persist useful state?</p>
<h3 id="in-memory-cache">In-memory Cache</h3>
<p>The most straightforward way to use this capacity is to store reusable data between requests. If we need a piece of data from external storage, and that same piece is needed again and again, we could store it after the first load in a global in-memory hashmap. Think of a simple read-through cache backed by an external persistent data store.</p>
<figure >
    
        <img src="in-memory.png"
            alt="In-memory cache in AWS Lambda in front of a persistent database"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>In-memory cache in AWS Lambda in front of a persistent database</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>
<p>This approach is still quite limited in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total size of the cache is up to 3GB (max size of AWS Lambda), which might not be enough for a large number of objects or large objects.</li>
<li>Any parallel request hits a different instance of the same AWS Lambda. The second instance then has to load the data from the data store once again.</li>
</ul>
<figure >
    
        <img src="two-in-memory.png"
            alt="A parallel request hits the second instance with no cache available"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>A parallel request hits the second instance with no cache available</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>
<p>Each instance has to store its copy of cached data, which reduces the overall efficiency. Also, cache invalidation might get tricky in this case, particularly because each instance has its own, highly unpredictable lifetime.</p>
<h3 id="distributed-cache">Distributed Cache</h3>
<p>The previous scenario described a local cache co-located with data processing logic. Can we move the cache out of the currently invoked instance, distribute it among many other instances, and have multiple lambdas caching different portions of the data set? This move would help both with the cache size and duplication issues.</p>
<figure >
    
        <img src="distributed-cache.png"
            alt="Application loads data from a distributed cache of multiple AWS Lambdas"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Application loads data from a distributed cache of multiple AWS Lambdas</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>
<p>The idea is to create a Distributed Cache as a Service, with design goals inspired by the serverless mindset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low management overhead</li>
<li>Scalability to hundreds or thousands of nodes</li>
<li>Pay per request</li>
</ul>
<p>The most significant potential upside is related to the cost structure. The cache capacity is billed only when a request needs an object. Such a pay-per-request model significantly differentiates against conventional cloud storage or cache services, which typically charge for memory capacity on an hourly basis whether the cached objects are accessed or not.</p>

<p>However, once again, serverless functions were not designed for stateful use cases. Utilizing the memory of cloud functions for object caching introduces non-trivial challenges due to the limitations and constraints of serverless computing platforms. The following list is specific to AWS Lambda, but other providers have very similar setups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited resource capacity is available: 1 or 2 CPU, up to several GB of memory, and limited network bandwidth.</li>
<li>Providers may reclaim a function and its memory at any time, creating a risk of loss of the cached data.</li>
<li>Each Lambda execution can run at most 900 seconds (15 minutes).</li>
<li>Strict network communication constraints are in place: Lambda only allows outbound network connections, meaning a Lambda function cannot be used to implement a server.</li>
<li>The lack of quality-of-service control. As a result, functions suffer from straggler issues, when response duration distributions have long tails.</li>
<li>Lambda functions run at EC2 Virtual Machines (VMs), where a single VM can host one or more functions. AWS provisions functions on the smallest possible number of VMs, which could cause severe network bandwidth contention for multiple network-intensive Lambda functions on the same host VM.</li>
<li>Executions are billed per 100 ms, even if a request only takes 5 or 10 ms.</li>
<li>No concurrent invocations are allowed, so the same instance can&rsquo;t handle multiple requests at the same time.</li>
<li>There is a non-trivial invocation latency on top of any response processing time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, that&rsquo;s an extensive list of pitfalls. Nonetheless, InfiniCache presents a careful combination of choosing the best use case, working around some issues, and hacking straight through the others.</p>
<h3 id="large-object-caching">Large Object Caching</h3>
<p>Traditional distributed cache products aren&rsquo;t great when it comes to caching large objects (megabytes):</p>
<ul>
<li>Large objects are accessed less often while consuming vast space in RAM.</li>
<li>They occupy memory and cause evictions of many small objects that might be reused shortly, thus hurting performance.</li>
<li>Requests to large objects consume significant network bandwidth, which may inevitably affect the latencies of small objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of these reasons, it&rsquo;s common <strong>not</strong> to cache large objects and retrieve them from the backing storage like S3 directly.</p>
<p>What is missing is a truly elastic cloud storage service model that charges tenants in a request-driven mode instead of per capacity usage, which the emerging serverless computing naturally enables.</p>
<h2 id="ii-infinicache">II. InfiniCache</h2>
<p>The paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.10483.pdf">InfiniCache: Exploiting Ephemeral Serverless Functions to Build a Cost-Effective Memory Cache</a> presents a prototype of a distributed cache service running on top of AWS Lambda. The service is aimed specifically at large object caching. It deploys a large fleet of Lambda functions, where each Lambda stores a slice of the total data pool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>InfiniCache offers a virtually infinite (yet cheap) short-term capacity, which is advantageous for large object caching, since the tenants can invoke many cloud functions but have the provider pay the cost of function caching.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors employ several smart techniques to work around the limitations that I described above and make the system performant and cost-efficient.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-lambda-functions">Multiple Lambda functions</h3>
<p>InfiniCache creates multiple AWS Lambdas, as opposed to multiple instances of the same Lambda. Each Lambda effectively runs on a single instance (container) that holds a slice of data. A second instance may be used for backups as explained below.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no dynamic scaling: the cache cluster is pre-provisioned to the level of required capacity. This does not incur a high fixed cost, though: each Lambda is still charged per invocation, not for the number of Lambda services or deployments.</p>
<figure >
    
        <img src="lambda-cache.png"
            alt="AWS Lambdas as cache storage units"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>AWS Lambdas as cache storage units</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>
<p>The described approach may sound very limiting. A single instance? Well, each instance can only handle a single request at a time, do the clients need to coordinate and wait for each other? How do the clients even know which Lambda to invoke to retrieve a piece of data?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why InfiniCache has an extra component called <strong>a proxy</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="proxy">Proxy</h3>
<p>A proxy is a static always-up well-known component deployed on a large EC2 virtual machine. A proxy has a stable endpoint and becomes the entry point for all end clients. It then talks to Lambdas via an internal protocol, as I explain below.</p>
<figure >
    
        <img src="proxy.png"
            alt="A client makes requests to the proxy which connects to a Lambda"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>A client makes requests to the proxy which connects to a Lambda</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>
<p>It&rsquo;s now the responsibility of the proxy to distribute blobs between Lambdas and persist their addresses between the requests.</p>
<p>There may be multiple proxies for large deployments. InfiniCache&rsquo;s client library determines the destination proxy (and therefore its backing Lambda pool) by using a consistent hashing-based load balancing approach.</p>
<h3 id="backward-connections">Backward Connections</h3>
<p>Firing a new Lambda invocation for each cache request proves to be inefficient: You pay for the minimum of 100 ms and block the entire instance for the single execution. Therefore, InfiniCache authors use a sophisticated hand-crafted model with two channels for proxy-to-lambda communication.</p>
<p>Traditional Lambda invocations are used only for activation and billed duration control. The same invocation is potentially reused to serve multiple cache requests via a separate TCP channel.</p>
<p>Since AWS Lambda does  not  allow  inbound  TCP  or  UDP  connections,  each Lambda runtime establishes a TCP connection with its designated proxy server the first time it is invoked. A Lambda node gets its proxy’s connection information via the invocation parameters.  The Lambda runtime then keeps the TCP connection established until reclaimed by the provider.</p>
<figure >
    
        <img src="channels.png"
            alt="During an active invocation, Lambda establishes a TCP connection for multiplexed data transfer"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>During an active invocation, Lambda establishes a TCP connection for multiplexed data transfer</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>
<p>Here is a somewhat simplified explanation of the protocol:</p>
<ol>
<li>At first, there is no active invocation of a given Lambda.</li>
<li>Whenever the proxy needs to retrieve a blob from a Lambda, it invokes the Lambda with a &ldquo;Ping&rdquo; message, passing the IP of the proxy in the request body.</li>
<li>The Lambda invocation is now activated, but it does NOT return yet. Instead, it establishes a TCP connection to the proxy IP and sends a &ldquo;Pong&rdquo; message over that second channel.</li>
<li>The proxy accepts the TCP connection. Now it can send requests for blob data over that connection. It sends the first request immediately.</li>
<li>The Lambda instance now serves multiple requests on the same TCP connection.</li>
<li>Every billing cycle, the Lambda instance decides whether to keep the invocation alive and keep serving requests over TCP, or to terminate the invocation to stop the billing.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>To maximize the use of each billing cycle and to avoid the overhead of restarting Lambdas, InfiniCache&rsquo;s Lambda runtime uses a timeout scheme to control how long a Lambda function runs. When a Lambda node is invoked by a chunk request, a timer is triggered to limit the function’s execution time. The timeout is initially set to expire within the first billing cycle.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If no further chunk request arrives within the first billing cycle, the timer expires and returns 2–10 ms (a short time buffer) before the 100 ms window ends.
If more than one request can be served within the current billing cycle, the heuristic extends the timeout by one more billing cycle, anticipating more incoming requests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This clever workaround overcomes two limitations simultaneously: adjusting to the round-up pricing model, and ensuring that parallel requests can be served by the single Lambda instance, both reusing the same memory cache.</p>
<h3 id="instance-sizes">Instance sizes</h3>
<p>AWS Lambda functions can be provisioned at a memory limit between 128 MB and 3 GB. The allocated CPU cycles are proportional to the provisioned RAM size.</p>
<p>InfiniCache authors find larger instances beneficial. Even though they end up paying more for each invocation, they greatly benefit from improved performance, reduced latency variation, and lack of network contention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We find that using relatively bigger Lambda functions largely eliminates Lambda co-location. Lambda’s VM hosts have approximately 3 GB memory.  As such, if we use Lambda functions with ≥ 1.5GB memory, every VM host is occupied exclusively by a single Lambda function.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="chunking-and-erasure-coding">Chunking and erasure coding</h3>
<p>To serve large files with minimal latency, InfiniCache breaks each file down into several chunks. The proxy stores each chunk on a separate AWS Lambda and requests them in parallel on retrieval. This protocol improves performance by utilizing the aggregated network bandwidth of multiple cloud functions in parallel.</p>
<p>On top of that, InfiniCache uses an approach called <strong>erasure coding</strong>. Redundant information is introduced into each chunk so that the full file could be recovered from a smaller subset of the pieces. For example, &ldquo;10+2&rdquo; encoding breaks each file into 12 chunks, but any 10 chunks are enough to restore the complete file. This redundancy helps fight long-tail latencies: the slowest responses can be ignored, so the stragglers have less effect on the overall latency of the system.</p>
<p>The paper compares several erasure coding schemes (&ldquo;10+0&rdquo;, &ldquo;10+1&rdquo;, &ldquo;10+2&rdquo;, etc.) and finds that 10+1—requiring 10 any chunks out of 11—provides the best trade-off between response latency and computational overhead of encoding.</p>
<p>Predictably, the non-redundant &ldquo;10+0&rdquo; encoding suffers from Lambda straggler issues, which outweighs the performance gained by the elimination of the decoding overhead.</p>
<p>Interestingly, breaking down a file into chunks becomes the responsibility of the client library. The encoding is too computation-heavy to be executed in the proxy.</p>
<h3 id="warm-ups-and-backup">Warm-ups and backup</h3>
<p>Amazon can reclaim any inactive instance of an AWS Lambda at any time. It&rsquo;s not possible to avoid this altogether, but InfiniCache does three things to mitigate the issue and keep the data around for longer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They issue periodic <a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/aws-lambda-warmer-as-pulumi-component/">warm-up</a> requests to each Lambda to prolong the instance lifespan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The redundancy of erasure coding helps recover lost chunks of a single object;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each cloud function periodically performs data synchronization with a clone of itself to minimize the chances that a reclaimed function causes a data loss.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last point is referred to as “backup” and is uniquely elegant, in my opinion. How does one backup an instance of AWS Lambda? They make the Lambda invoke itself! Because such invocation can’t land on the same instance (the instance is busy calling), the second instance of the same Lambda is going to be created. The two instances can now sync the data, which happens over TCP through a relay co-located with the proxy.</p>
<figure >
    
        <img src="backup.png"
            alt="AWS Lambda creates the second execution of itself and syncs data between the two executions"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>AWS Lambda creates the second execution of itself and syncs data between the two executions</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>
<p>If AWS decides to reclaim the primary instance, the next invocation naturally lands on the secondary instance, which already has the data in memory.</p>
<figure >
    
        <img src="failover.png"
            alt="AWS reclaims the primary instance which automatically promotes the secondary instance with hot data"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>AWS reclaims the primary instance which automatically promotes the secondary instance with hot data</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>
<p>The promoted instance can now start another replication to create a backup of its own.</p>
<p>Both warm-ups and backups largely contribute to the total cost of the solution, but the authors find this cost justified in terms of improved cache hit rates.</p>
<h2 id="iii-practical-evaluation">III. Practical Evaluation</h2>
<p>The authors implemented a prototype of InfiniCache and benchmarked it against several synthetic tests and a real-life workload of a production Docker registry. Below are some key numbers from their real-life workload comparison against an ElastiCache cluster (a Redis service managed by AWS). Mind that the workload was selected to be a good match for InfiniCache properties (large objects with infrequent access).</p>
<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>
<p>InfiniCache is one to two orders of magnitude cheaper than ElastiCache (managed Redis cluster) on some workloads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the end of hour 50, ElastiCache costs $518.4, while InfiniCache with all objects costs $20.52. Caching only large objects bigger than 10 MB leads to a cost of $16.51 for InfiniCache. InfiniCache pay-per-use serverless substrate effectively brings down the total cost by 96.8% with a cost effectiveness improvement of 31x. By disabling the backup option, InfiniCache further lowers down the cost to $5.41, which is 96x cheaper than ElastiCache.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, they find that serverless computing platforms are not cost-effective for small-object caching with frequent access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hourly cost increases monotonically with the access rate, and eventually overshoots ElastiCache when the access rate exceeds 312 K requests per hour (86 requests per second).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>Here are the key conclusions based on a production-like test of InfiniCache:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compared to S3, InfiniCache achieves superior performance improvement for large objects: it&rsquo;s at least 100x for about 60% of all large requests. This trend demonstrates the efficacy of the idea of using a distributed in-memory cache in front of a cloud object store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>InfiniCache is particularly good at optimizing latencies for large objects. It is approximately on-par with ElastiCache for objects sizing from 1–100 MB, but InfiniCache achieves consistently lower latencies for objects larger than 100 MB, due to I/O parallelism. However, I suppose chunking could improve the results of ElastiCache too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>InfiniCache incurs significant overhead for objects smaller than 1 MB, since fetching an object often requires to invoke Lambda functions, which takes on average 13 ms and is much slower than  directly fetching a small object from ElastiCache.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>
<p>Hit/miss ratio is an essential metric of any cache. A cache miss is usually a result of an object loss when all the replicas of several chunks are gone.</p>
<p>For the large object workload, a production-like test resulted in the availability of 95.4%. InfiniCache without backups sees a substantially lower availability of just 81.4%.</p>
<h2 id="iv-future-directions">IV. Future Directions</h2>
<p>Can a system like InfiniCache be productized and used for production workloads?</p>
<h3 id="service-providers-policy-changes">Service provider&rsquo;s policy changes</h3>
<p>InfiniCache uses several clever tricks to exploit the properties of the existing AWS Lambda service as it works today. However, the behavior of Lambda instances is broadly a black box and changes over time. Even small behavior changes may potentially have a massive impact on the properties of InfiniCache-like systems.</p>
<p>Even worse, service  providers may change their internal implementations and policies <em>in response</em> to systems like InfiniCache. Ideally, any production system would rely on explicit product features of serverless functions rather than implicitly observed characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="explicit-provisioning">Explicit provisioning</h3>
<p>AWS Lambda has recently launched a new feature called <a href="https://mikhail.io/2019/12/aws-lambda-provisioned-concurrency-no-cold-starts/">provisioned concurrency</a>, that allows pinning warm Lambda functions in memory for a fixed hourly fee. Provisioned Lambdas may still get reclaimed and re-initialized periodically, but the reclamation frequency is low compared to non-provisioned Lambdas.</p>
<p>The pay-per-hour pricing component is quite significant, which brings the cost closer to EC2 VMs&rsquo; pricing model. Nonetheless, it opens up research opportunities for hybrid serverless-oriented cloud economics with higher predictability.</p>
<h3 id="internal-implementation-by-a-cloud-provider">Internal implementation by a cloud provider</h3>
<p>Finally, instead of fighting with third-party implementations of stateful systems on top of dynamic function pools, cloud providers could potentially leverage such techniques themselves. A new cloud service could provide short-term caching for data-intensive applications such as big data analytics.</p>
<p>Having the complete picture, datacenter operators would operate a white-box solution and could use the knowledge to optimize data availability and locality. I look forward to new storage products that can more efficiently utilize ephemeral datacenter resources.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Running Azure Functions Docker container inside Google Cloud Run managed service</blockquote>

<p>Suppose you are a .NET developer, you love the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model, but you want to run your serverless functions in Google Cloud. You want to keep using C# or F#, and still leverage all serverless benefits&mdash;ease of use, scalability, elasticity, pay-per-value cost model&mdash;running in GCP.</p>

<p>You look at Google Cloud Functions, the native FaaS service of Google Cloud, but it only supports JavaScript, Python, and Go. No C# or F#. Time to give up on the plans?</p>

<p>Not so quickly!</p>

<h2 id="google-azure-functions-wat">Google Azure Functions?! Wat?</h2>

<p>You are probably already familiar with Azure Functions&mdash;the .NET-based FaaS runtime in Azure. Azure Functions has two faces: it&rsquo;s a managed service in the Azure cloud, and also it is a self-contained runtime that can run anywhere: on your local machine, in a VM, or in a container. As I&rsquo;m going to demonstrate, it can run in Google Cloud too.</p>

<p><img src="teaser.png" alt="Azure Functions Google Cloud Run" /></p>

<p>Now, if I simply run an Azure Functions host on a VM in Google Cloud, I don&rsquo;t get all the serverless properties like scalability and pay-for-value. This is where Google Cloud Run comes into the mix.</p>

<p>Cloud Run is a fully managed cloud service that takes a container image and deploys it as an elastic HTTP application with scaling from zero to hero and applying per-request pricing. Cloud Run can host pretty much any container that listens to HTTP requests at a given port.</p>

<p>At the same time, Microsoft provides an official image of Azure Functions host. The host is a web application listening for HTTP requests&hellip; It sounds like we can stick it into Cloud Run!</p>

<h2 id="deploying-azure-functions-to-cloud-run">Deploying Azure Functions to Cloud Run</h2>

<p>My plan has three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Develop the code for an Azure Function App</li>
<li>Pack it as a Docker image that would fit the requirements of Google Cloud Run</li>
<li>Deploy the image as a Cloud Run service</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="net-azure-function">.NET Azure Function</h3>

<p>Use your favorite tool to create a new Function App. I employed <code>func</code> CLI to create a new Function App project in C# and define an HTTP Function &ldquo;HttpExample&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">[FunctionName(&#34;HttpExample&#34;)]

    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, &#34;get&#34;)] HttpRequest req)
{
    <span style="color:#2b91af">string</span> name = (<span style="color:#2b91af">string</span>)req.Query[<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;name&#34;</span>] ?? <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;World&#34;</span>;
    <span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> service = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;K_SERVICE&#34;</span>) ?? <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;&lt;unknown&gt;&#34;</span>;
    <span style="color:#00f">return</span> <span style="color:#00f">new</span> OkObjectResult(<span style="color:#a31515">$&#34;Hello from Azure Function in {service}, {name}&#34;</span>);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>It&rsquo;s a standard hello-world Function, except it also retrieves the value of the <code>K_SERVICE</code> environment variable and appends it to the response. This variable should be present when hosted in Cloud Run.</p>

<h3 id="container-image">Container image</h3>

<p>Now, we can wrap the Function App into a Docker image. Here is my <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-dockerfile" data-lang="dockerfile"><span style="color:#00f">FROM</span><span style="color:#a31515"> mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.0 AS installer-env</span><span style="">

<p>It uses the .NET Core SDK to build the application and publish the binaries to the <code>wwwroot</code> folder. Then I use the official Azure Functions host image to run the application from <code>wwwroot</code>.</p>

<p>The only statement that I have to customize for Cloud Run is <code>ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:8080</code>. It instructs my application to listen on the port 8080: the one defined by the Cloud Run&rsquo;s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/container-contract">container contract</a>.</p>

<h3 id="deploy-to-cloud-run">Deploy to Cloud Run</h3>

<p>Finally, I can deploy the container definition to Google Cloud Run service. I use Pulumi to deploy all the infrastructure, see <a href="https://mikhail.io/2020/02/serverless-containers-with-google-cloud-run/">this post</a> for a detailed walkthrough.</p>

<p>You can find the complete code of Azure Function deployment to Cloud Run <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/mikhailio-hugo/tree/master/content/2020/02/azure-functions-in-google-cloud-run/code">here</a>. After running <code>pulumi up</code>, I get a URL back</p>

<pre><code>endpoint: &quot;https://cloudrun-functions-4f40772-q5zdxwsb2a-ew.a.run.app/api/HttpExample?name=&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>I can append my name, query the endpoint, and get the response back:</p>

<pre><code>curl $(pulumi stack output endpoint)Mikhail
Hello from Azure Function in cloudrun-functions-4f40772, Mikhail
</code></pre>

<p>It works! My Function confirms it&rsquo;s running in the <code>cloudrun-functions-4f40772</code> Cloud Run service.</p>

<h2 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and Cons</h2>

<p>I showed that it&rsquo;s possible to run an Azure Function App inside the managed Google Cloud Run service. Let&rsquo;s spend a moment to discuss the benefits and limitations of this approach.</p>

<h3 id="the-good-parts">The good parts</h3>

<p>You take full advantage of a serverless application model:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google operates Cloud Run and requires next to none management from your side.</li>
<li>The service automatically scales from zero to an arbitrary number of instances based on the actual workload.</li>
<li>You pay per request in chunks of 100 ms. An application that needs to handle few requests may stay below the free allowance.</li>
</ul>

<p>You write your application in a familiar language. I used .NET, it can be C#, F#, or VB, but the same approach should also work for other runtimes supported by Azure Functions, for example, JVM or PowerShell.</p>

<p>You can take advantage of many (but not all, see below) features of Azure Functions: HTTP routes, including parameters, authorization modes, logging, input and output bindings.</p>

<h3 id="not-so-great-parts">Not so great parts</h3>

<p>There is one substantial limitation to my approach, however. Cloud Run can only run HTTP-based workloads, so the set of Azure Function triggers available to you is basically limited to HTTP, EventGrid, and custom triggers based on HTTP. You can&rsquo;t deploy Functions listening to events like Service Bus, or Storage Queues. However, since your application runs in Google Cloud anyway, do you really need those? Google Pub/Sub has HTTP endpoint integration out of the box.</p>

<p>Azure Functions container is an ASP.NET Core application, and we ran it in Google Cloud Run. You may want to forgo the Azure Functions host and deploy your own custom ASP.NET Core application to Cloud Run. Both are possible, and the choice is yours.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Open source and open standards open (dfjokasj) new horizons of possibilities. The team behind Azure Functions provides a way to host Function App inside containers, and Google Cloud Run service enables running arbitrary containers in a serverless manner. Therefore, we can combine the two products to come up with the usage that nobody anticipated in advance.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that cool? Happy hacking, my cloud friends!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Google Cloud Run is the latest addition to the serverless compute family. While it may look similar to existing services of public cloud, the feature set makes Cloud Run unique.</blockquote>

<p>Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/">Cloud Run</a> is the latest addition to the serverless compute family. While it may look similar to existing services of public cloud, the feature set makes Cloud Run unique:</p>

<ul>
<li>Docker as a deployment package enables using any language, runtime, framework, or library that can respond to an HTTP request.</li>
<li>Automatic scaling, including scale to zero, means you pay for what you consume with no fixed cost and no management overhead.</li>
<li>HTTP load-balancing out of the box simplifies the usage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cloud Run is targeted very specifically at stateless web applications. It uses ephemeral containers, and each execution is limited to 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Today, we will deploy our first Cloud Run services with Pulumi. Then, we&rsquo;ll discuss pricing and compare Cloud Run to the competition.</p>

<h2 id="hello-cloud-run">Hello Cloud Run</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start by deploying a pre-built container image provided by Google to a Cloud Run service.</p>

<p>To follow along, create a new Pulumi project with the <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/gcp/">Get Started with Google Cloud</a> guide.</p>

<h3 id="enable-cloud-run-for-the-project">Enable Cloud Run for the project</h3>

<p>As with any other service of Google Cloud, you need to enable it for the target project before the first deployment. You can do so with the <code>gcp.projects.Service</code> resource:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> enableCloudRun = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> gcp.projects.Service(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;EnableCloudRun&#34;</span>, {
    service: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;run.googleapis.com&#34;</span>,
});</code></pre></div>
<p>Note: If you destroy the Pulumi stack and delete the <code>projects.Service</code> resource, the Cloud Run service will be disabled again. If you use Cloud Run in multiple Pulumi stacks, you should move the service management to a central location, i.e., a shared stack.</p>

<h3 id="choose-a-location">Choose a location</h3>

<p>Cloud Run is a regional service: all container instances run in a single location of your choice.</p>

<p>Set the region setting to one of the currently supported locations: <code>us-central1</code> (Iowa), <code>us-east1</code> (South Carolina), <code>europe-west1</code>( Belgium), or <code>asia-northeast1</code> (Tokyo).</p>

<pre><code>pulumi config set gcp:region &lt;region&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, the program can read the value and reuse it for all resources:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#008000">// Location to deploy Cloud Run services
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span><span style="color:#00f">const</span> location = gcp.config.region || <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;us-central1&#34;</span>;</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="deploy-a-cloud-run-service">Deploy a Cloud Run service</h3>

<p>Google provides a pre-deployed &ldquo;Hello Cloud Run&rdquo; image at <code>gcr.io/cloudrun/hello</code>. The following resource deploys that image to your GCP project with the default settings.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> helloService = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> gcp.cloudrun.Service(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;hello&#34;</span>, {
    location,
    template: {
        spec: {
            containers: [
                { image: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;gcr.io/cloudrun/hello&#34;</span> },
            ],
        },
    },
}, { dependsOn: <span style="color:#2b91af">enableCloudRun</span> });</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="expose-unrestricted-http-access">Expose unrestricted HTTP access</h3>

<p>By default, Google does not expose HTTP endpoints of a Cloud Run service to the Internet. To make it publicly available, you should grant the <code>roles/run.invoker</code> role to <code>allUsers</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> iamHello = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> gcp.cloudrun.IamMember(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;hello-everyone&#34;</span>, {
    service: <span style="color:#2b91af">helloService.name</span>,
    location,
    role: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;roles/run.invoker&#34;</span>,
    member: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;allUsers&#34;</span>,
});</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that the Contributor role is required for the user who executes Pulumi deployment to grant the access.</p>

<h3 id="try-it-out">Try it out</h3>

<p>Each Cloud Run service automatically gets a run.app subdomain. You can export the exact URL as a Pulumi output.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#008000">// Export the URL
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span><span style="color:#00f">export</span> <span style="color:#00f">const</span> helloUrl = helloService.status.url;</code></pre></div>
<p>Run <code>pulumi up</code> to deploy all the resources.</p>

<pre><code>$ pulumi up
...
Outputs:
  ~ helloUrl: &quot;https://hello-585ad15-q4wszdxb2a-ew.a.run.app&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Navigate to the URL to see the welcome screen:</p>

<p><img src="./cloud-run-hello-running.png" alt="Cloud Run Hello World container running" /></p>

<p>Congratulations, your first Cloud Run service is up and running. Now, it&rsquo;s time to deploy some custom code.</p>

<h2 id="deploy-a-custom-application">Deploy a Custom Application</h2>

<p>Cloud Run can run any Docker container so that you can write the application code in a language of your choice. I picked Ruby as an example of a language that is not supported by Cloud Functions.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-ruby-web-app">Create a Ruby web app</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s create an <code>app</code> subfolder and place all application files there. The first file app.rb is a Hello World web application in Ruby.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb">require <span style="color:#a31515">&#39;sinatra&#39;</span>

get <span style="color:#a31515">&#39;/&#39;</span> <span style="color:#00f">do</span>
  target = ENV[<span style="color:#a31515">&#39;TARGET&#39;</span>] || <span style="color:#a31515">&#39;Pulumi&#39;</span>
  <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Hello </span><span style="color:#a31515">#{</span>target<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">!</span><span style="color:#a31515">\n</span><span style="color:#a31515">&#34;</span>
<span style="color:#00f">end</span></code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/blob/master/gcp-ts-cloudrun/app/Gemfile">Gemfile</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/blob/master/gcp-ts-cloudrun/app/Gemfile.lock">Gemfile.lock</a> files configure the required gems (packages).</p>

<h3 id="define-a-docker-image">Define a Docker image</h3>

<p><code>Dockerfile</code> defines the container image to deploy. It is based on a generic Ruby image, copies the application files, and runs the web application.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-dockerfile" data-lang="dockerfile"><span style="color:#008000"># Use the official lightweight Ruby image.</span><span style="">

<p>Note that nothing in this web application is specific to Cloud Run.</p>

<h3 id="build-and-publish-the-docker-image">Build and publish the Docker image</h3>

<p>Cloud Run can only deploy images from Google Cloud Registry (GCR). Therefore, our Pulumi program needs to build the Docker image with the sample Ruby application and push it to GCR.</p>

<p>Run <code>gcloud auth configure-docker</code> in your command line to configure your local Docker installation to use GCR endpoints.</p>

<p>Run <code>npm i @pulumi/docker</code> to install the Pulumi Docker SDK. Then, add the <code>docker.Image</code> resource to the Pulumi program.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> myImage = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> docker.Image(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;ruby-image&#34;</span>, {
    imageName: <span style="color:#2b91af">pulumi.interpolate</span><span style="color:#a31515">`gcr.io/</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>gcp.config.project<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">/my-ruby-app:v1.0.0`</span>,
    build: {
        context: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;./app&#34;</span>,
    },
});</code></pre></div>
<p>Pulumi takes care of building the image in the <code>app</code> folder and uploading it to GCR.</p>

<h3 id="deploy-to-cloud-run">Deploy to Cloud Run</h3>

<p>Now, you can deploy another Cloud Run service and point it to the custom image.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> rubyService = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> gcp.cloudrun.Service(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;ruby&#34;</span>, {
    location,
    template: {
        spec: {
            containers: [{
                image: <span style="color:#2b91af">myImage.imageName</span>,
                resources: {
                    limits: {
                        memory: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;1Gi&#34;</span>,
                    },
                },
            }],
            containerConcurrency: <span style="color:#2b91af">50</span>,
        },
    },
}, { dependsOn: <span style="color:#2b91af">enableCloudRun</span> });</code></pre></div>
<p>This snippet illustrates two additional configuration values. The memory limit defines the amount of RAM available to each container. Container concurrency defines how many requests each container instance may process in parallel at any given time. Both parameters influence the price of the deployment, as explained in the Pricing section below.</p>

<p>Currently, itâ€™s not possible to use partial vCPU or multiple vCPUs per instance: your instance has always one vCPU assigned. You can adjust the memory from 128Mb to 2Gb.</p>

<p>Finally, don&rsquo;t forget to enable unrestricted access and export the public URL.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> iamRuby = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> gcp.cloudrun.IamMember(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;ruby-everyone&#34;</span>, {
    service: <span style="color:#2b91af">rubyService.name</span>,
    location,
    role: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;roles/run.invoker&#34;</span>,
    member: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;allUsers&#34;</span>,
});

<span style="color:#00f">export</span> <span style="color:#00f">const</span> rubyUrl = rubyService.status.url;</code></pre></div>
<p>After deploying the program, you should be able to access the application with an HTTP call.</p>

<pre><code>$ curl &quot;$(pulumi stack output rubyUrl)&quot;
Hello Pulumi!
</code></pre>

<p>You can find the complete example in the Pulumi examples <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/blob/master/gcp-ts-cloudrun">Github repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>

<p>Cloud Run pricing is entirely consumption-based. After you exhaust the free tier, you start paying for four components, combined:</p>

<ul>
<li>Per CPU time ($24.00 / million seconds)</li>
<li>Per memory consumption ($2.50 / million GB-seconds)</li>
<li>Per request ($0.40 / million requests)</li>
<li>Egress traffic, same as any other Google Cloud usage</li>
</ul>

<p>Both time-based measurements are rounded up to the nearest 100 ms. All the provisioned memory is charged, the actual Mb/Gb consumption doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that the CPU and memory metrics are calculated per active instance (host, provisioned container), not per request. Each Cloud Run instance can handle multiple requests concurrently. Overlapping executions aren&rsquo;t double charged: billable time begins with the start of the first request and ends at the end of the last request.</p>

<p>The following picture illustrates the pricing for three executions running on the same container host.</p>

<p><img src="./executions.png" alt="Parallel executions at Cloud Run" /></p>

<p>Multiple requests can share the allocated CPU and memory, so it makes sense to set the concurrency setting as high as possible for a given application (but not higher). This model is a big difference to Cloud Functions, which are charged for each request independently.</p>

<h2 id="comparing-cloud-run-to-other-services">Comparing Cloud Run to Other Services</h2>

<p>Despite the existence of multiple services that look somewhat similar, Cloud Run is unique in its capabilities.</p>

<h3 id="google-cloud-functions">Google Cloud Functions</h3>

<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/">Google Cloud Functions</a> (GCF) service deploys snippets of code as functions, while Cloud Run deploys a web application packaged as a Docker image. Currently, GCF only supports three runtimes (Node.js, Python, and Go), while Cloud Run can run practically any language and any runtime.</p>

<p>GCF has a notion of events and triggers: it can natively integrate with Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, Cloud Firestore. Cloud Run is all about handling HTTP requests: Any connection to another service has to go via HTTP.</p>

<h3 id="aws-fargate">AWS Fargate</h3>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">AWS Fargate</a> deploys container images. It requires an ECS cluster to run on and imposes more configuration burden on the user, including networking, load balancing, auto-scaling, and service discovery. Pulumi Crosswalk for AWS <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/crosswalk/aws/ecs/">can help</a> with these tasks.</p>

<p>Fargate is capable of hosting long-running workloads. Therefore, Fargate&rsquo;s scaling model is not tied to individual requests, and there is no scale-to-zero out of the box.</p>

<p>With Cloud Run, there&rsquo;s no notion of a cluster to manage, the scaling and billing models are based on individual requests. However, the workloads are HTTP-only, with a maximum duration of 15 minutes per call.</p>

<h3 id="azure-container-instances">Azure Container Instances</h3>

<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/">Azure Container Instances</a> (ACI) can also run arbitrary containers and has built-in HTTP endpoints. However, there&rsquo;s no auto-scaling: you get a single host for each instance. Also, there&rsquo;s no load balancing capability across multiple instances.</p>

<p>Cloud Run is elastically scalable, which positions it much better to host applications with variable workloads.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Cloud Run is a service with a unique combination of serverless ease of use and pricing with the full power of container deployments. It is easier to manage than Fargate, has automatic scaling missing from ACI, and greater flexibility compared to GCF. With concurrent requests model, Cloud Run is well-positioned to be significantly cheaper than Cloud Functions for some scenarios.</p>

<p>AWS recently <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-provisioned-concurrency-for-lambda-functions/">announced</a> the launch of <strong>Provisioned Concurrency</strong>, a new feature of AWS Lambda that intends to solve the problem of cold starts. In this article, we take another look at the problem of latency-critical serverless applications, and how the new feature impacts the status-quo.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency-model-of-aws-lambda">Concurrency Model of AWS Lambda</h2>

<p>Despite being serverless, AWS Lambda uses lightweight containers to process incoming requests. Every container, or worker, can process only a single request at any given time.</p>

<figure >
    
        <img src="executions.png"
            alt="Overlapping executions land on separate workers"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Overlapping executions land on separate workers</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Because of this, the number of concurrent requests defines the number of required workers that a specific AWS Lambda function needs to serve a response at any given moment.</p>

<h2 id="cold-starts">Cold Starts</h2>

<p>How does AWS know how many workers it needs to run for a given function? Well, it doesn&rsquo;t know in advance. AWS allocates new workers on-demand as the Lambda gets invoked.</p>

<p>Whenever Lambda receives a request but it has no idle workers, the control plane assigns a new generic worker to it. The worker then has to download the custom code or binaries of your Lambda and load them into memory before it can service the request. This process takes time, which significantly increases response latency.</p>

<p>The issue of sporadically slow responses caused by the need to increase the pool of workers is known as <strong>Cold Start</strong>. Cold starts are consistently the top concern about the applicability of serverless technologies to latency-sensitive workloads. There are numerous articles about the problem, including many articles I have written in the <a href="https://mikhail.io/serverless/coldstarts/">Cold Starts</a> section on my website</p>

<h2 id="warming">Warming</h2>

<p>Cold starts don&rsquo;t occur for the majority of requests because AWS Lambda reuses workers between subsequent invocations. However, if a particular worker is idle for too long (usually, several minutes), AWS may decide to recycle and return it to the generic pool.</p>

<p>A trick known as <strong>Lambda Warmers</strong> uses kept-alive workers to reduce the frequency of cold starts. The idea is to have a CloudWatch timer that fires every few minutes and sends <code>N</code> parallel requests to the target Lambda. If all those requests land at the same time, AWS has to provision at least <code>N</code> workers to process them. The actual operation doesn&rsquo;t have to do any useful work, but it resets the recycling timer back to zero.</p>

<p>There are a few drawbacks with this approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a valid request comes at the same time as warming requests, it might hit a cold start.</li>
<li>Extra logic is needed in the Lambda code to detect warming requests and short-circuit them instead of doing useful work.</li>
<li>CloudWatch rules require additional setup and management.</li>
<li>The result is still best-effort: Lambda still recycles workers from time to time.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more details about how Pulumi can help with some of these issues in <a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/aws-lambda-warmer-as-pulumi-component/">AWS Lambda Warmer as Pulumi Component</a>.</p>

<h2 id="provisioned-concurrency">Provisioned Concurrency</h2>

<p>At re:Invent 2019, AWS introduced Lambda <strong>Provisioned Concurrency</strong>&mdash;a feature to work around cold starts. The base concurrency model doesn&rsquo;t change. However, you can request a given number of workers to be always-warm and dedicated to a specific Lambda.</p>

<p>Here is an example of configuring the provisioned concurrency with Pulumi in TypeScript:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> lambda = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> aws.lambda.Function(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;mylambda&#34;</span>, {
    code: <span style="color:#2b91af">new</span> pulumi.asset.FileArchive(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;./app&#34;</span>),
    handler: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;handler&#34;</span>,
    role: <span style="color:#2b91af">role.arn</span>,
    publish: <span style="color:#2b91af">true</span>,
});

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> fixed = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> aws.lambda.ProvisionedConcurrencyConfig(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;fixed-concurrency&#34;</span>, {
  functionName: <span style="color:#2b91af">lambda.name</span>,
  qualifier: <span style="color:#2b91af">lambda.version</span>,
  provisionedConcurrentExecutions: <span style="color:#2b91af">2</span>,
});</code></pre></div>
<p>The snippet sets the provisioned concurrency for <code>mylambda</code> to a fixed value of <code>2</code>. Note that concurrency is provisioned per Lambda version, and it can&rsquo;t be set for the <code>$LATEST</code> version alias. Therefore, I set the <code>publish</code> attribute of my Lambda to <code>true</code> and reference a specific version of the Lambda in provisioning.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-provisioned-concurrency">Dynamic Provisioned Concurrency</h2>

<p>A fixed level of provisioned concurrency works well for stable workloads.</p>

<figure >
    
        <img src="steady.png"
            alt="Fixed provisioned concurrency for uniform workloads"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Fixed provisioned concurrency for uniform workloads</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>However, many workloads fluctuate a lot. Extreme elasticity and lack of configuration parameters have always been the essential benefits of AWS Lambda. It works great if you can tolerate the cold starts that come during scale-out. If not, you can explore more advanced scenarios for provisioning concurrency dynamically.</p>

<p>Instead of choosing a permanently fixed value, you can configure provisioned concurrency to autoscale. The first required component is the autoscaling target:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> resourceId = pulumi.interpolate<span style="color:#a31515">`function:</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>lambda.name<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">:</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>lambda.version<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span>;
<span style="color:#00f">const</span> target = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> aws.appautoscaling.Target(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;target&#34;</span>, {
    resourceId,
    serviceNamespace: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;lambda&#34;</span>,
    scalableDimension: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;lambda:function:ProvisionedConcurrency&#34;</span>,
    minCapacity: <span style="color:#2b91af">1</span>,
    maxCapacity: <span style="color:#2b91af">10</span>,
});</code></pre></div>
<p>The second component is the autoscaling policy, which defines the conditions when scaling starts. There are two important ways to adapt your concurrency provisioning to traffic patterns.</p>

<h3 id="scheduled-profile">Scheduled profile</h3>

<p>Quite often, increases in request rates are partially predictable. For example, usage increases during business hours and decreases at night.</p>

<figure >
    
        <img src="scheduled.png"
            alt="Provisioned concurrency matches predictable workload changes"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Provisioned concurrency matches predictable workload changes</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The following snippet sets two scheduled rules that switch between two levels of provisioned concurrency every day.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">function</span> scheduledConcurrency(name: <span style="color:#2b91af">string</span>, cron: <span style="color:#2b91af">string</span>, capacity: <span style="color:#2b91af">number</span>) {
    <span style="color:#00f">return</span> <span style="color:#00f">new</span> aws.appautoscaling.ScheduledAction(<span style="color:#a31515">`schedule-</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>name<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span>, {
        resourceId,
        serviceNamespace: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;lambda&#34;</span>,
        scalableDimension: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;lambda:function:ProvisionedConcurrency&#34;</span>,
        scalableTargetAction: {
            minCapacity: <span style="color:#2b91af">capacity</span>,
            maxCapacity: <span style="color:#2b91af">capacity</span>,
        },
        schedule: <span style="color:#a31515">`cron(</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>cron<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">)`</span>,
    }, { dependsOn: [target]});
}

scheduledConcurrency(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;day&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;0 8 * * ? *&#34;</span>, 10);
scheduledConcurrency(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;night&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;0 18 * * ? *&#34;</span>, 2);</code></pre></div>
<p>The example defines a helper function and calls it twice to set two schedules with different parameters.</p>

<h3 id="autoscaling-based-on-utilization">Autoscaling based on utilization</h3>

<p>If your workload pattern is less predictable, you can configure autoscaling for provisioned concurrency based on the measured utilization.</p>

<figure >
    
        <img src="variable.png"
            alt="Provisioned concurrency matches the variation in workload"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Provisioned concurrency matches the variation in workload</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Here is a basic example of a dynamic scaling policy.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> scaledConcurrency = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> aws.appautoscaling.Policy(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;autoscaling&#34;</span>, {
    resourceId,
    serviceNamespace: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;lambda&#34;</span>,
    scalableDimension: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;lambda:function:ProvisionedConcurrency&#34;</span>,
    policyType: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;TargetTrackingScaling&#34;</span>,
    targetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration: {
        targetValue: <span style="color:#2b91af">0.8</span>,
        predefinedMetricSpecification: {
            predefinedMetricType: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;LambdaProvisionedConcurrencyUtilization&#34;</span>,
        },
    },
}, { dependsOn: [target]});</code></pre></div>
<p>Currently, there are issues with autoscaling based on the metrics, which makes provisioned concurrency scale less effectively than what the chart above shows. Hopefully, Amazon will fix these issues soon.</p>

<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>

<p>While hand-crafted Lambda warmers are virtually free, provisioned concurrency can be costly. The new pricing is an integral part of the change: Instead of purely per-call model, AWS charges per hour for provisioned capacity.</p>

<p>You would pay $0.015 per hour per GB of provisioned worker memory, even if a worker handled zero requests.</p>

<p>The per-invocation price gets a discount: $0.035 per GB-hour instead of the regular $0.06 per GB-hour. This change means that fully-utilized workers would be cheaper if provisioned compared to on-demand workers.</p>

<figure >
    
        <img src="pricing.png"
            alt="Comparison of the cost of a 1GB worker for two billing models"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Comparison of the cost of a 1GB worker for two billing models</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The equilibrium point is at 60% utilization. Note that because the billed duration is rounded up to the nearest 100 ms for each execution, the utilization is not limited to 100%. A series of sequential executions can be processed by a single worker. If each execution is 10 ms, the charge is still 100 ms, and the total utilization can be as high as 1000% in terms of the chart above!</p>

<p>Finally, be careful to clean up your resources after any experiments: Leaving running workers with provisioned concurrency can be expensive! Using <code>pulumi destroy</code> removes resources after you finish experimenting.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Provisioned concurrency brings the long-awaited solution to cold starts in AWS Lambda. However, it comes at a cost in terms of a direct impact on billing and management overhead to provision concurrency at optimal levels.</p>

<p>For high-load functions where utilization is continuously above a known level of requests, it makes sense to set the provisioned concurrency to that level to save money and have the guarantee of warm workers.</p>

<p>If your Lambda hosts a latency-sensitive API, especially with runtimes like Java and .NET, you should strive to find the right balance between the percentage of requests that result in a cold start and the money spent on concurrency. Autoscaling should help once AWS has fixed the initial glitches that slipped into their current services.</p>

<p>If you want to try this for yourself, we&rsquo;ve updated the <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/blob/master/aws-ts-serverless-raw/">Serverless App example</a> to show off the scenario of configurable AWS Lambda provisioned concurrency.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>How Santa Cloud uses F# and Pulumi to bring cloud resources to the homes of software engineers.</blockquote>

<p><em>The post is a part of
<a href="https://sergeytihon.com/2019/11/05/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2019/">F# Advent Calendar 2019</a>.
It&rsquo;s Christmas time!</em></p>

<p>Cloud is everywhere, and yet it&rsquo;s still inaccessible to millions of developers and IT pros. With shining yet cloudy eyes return they from KubeCon&rsquo;s and re:Invent&rsquo;s, just to pick up an issue in Jira, fix yet another <code>SingletonProxyFactoryBean</code> in their J2EE application, commit it to SVN, and hope it will be delivered in three months to the data center in their HQ basement.</p>

<p>But hey, it&rsquo;s December now, which means it&rsquo;s time to write a letter to Santa Cloud! Santa Cloud brings gifts to the homes of well-behaved engineers on the night of Christmas Eve. He accomplishes this feat with the aid of his elves, who make the toys in their glorious workshops in the State of Washington.</p>

<p><img src="elves.jpg" alt="Cloud Elves" /></p>

<p>Here are some typical letters that Santa gets these days:</p>

<blockquote>I maintain 15 different apps, and each one has a custom deployment workflow. If only I had a <b>Kubernetes</b> cluster, I would stick all the apps in it and let the blue/green deployments do the magic!</blockquote>

<blockquote>My ten-year-old legacy application was designed for twenty users, and now it has to handle twenty thousand. It reached its performance limits! If only I could port it to <b>Serverless</b>, this would fix all my scalability issues.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>We have 2 TB of data to analyze! Could you please send me a data lake and a <strong>Spark</strong> cluster? Actually, can I have two&hellip; or maybe three?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s enough cloud for everyone! Perhaps, a naughty engineer, who created a lot of technical debt and meeting invites, might only get a cozy single-core VM for their LAMP-stack website. But the lucky ones might get a whole Kubernetes cluster for themselves!</p>

<h2 id="behind-the-snow-curtains">Behind the Snow Curtains</h2>

<p>While cloud elves are good at provisioning the underlying hardware and providing services, Santa still needs to coordinate them to fulfill wishes. There are millions of aspiring cloud engineers, and all of them believe in Santa. It&rsquo;s not feasible to click the buttons in web portals or run ad-hoc scripts for each and every wishlist.</p>

<p>Luckily, Santa Cloud is good at programming and automation. He codes in <a href="https://fsharp.org">F#</a>, and he&rsquo;s one of the early customers of the .NET SDK for <a href="https://pulumi.com">Pulumi</a>. Hey, it&rsquo;s my fairy tale, so I choose the tech stack, thank you. Worry not, even if you are not familiar with F# or Pulumi, you will be able to follow along.</p>

<p>The workflow looks approximately like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Represent a letter as a value in the program</li>
<li>Pick an elf which can fulfill the desire</li>
<li>Produce the resource</li>
<li>Wrap a note to the recipient</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="parsing-wishlists">Parsing wishlists</h3>

<p>Too bad, not every wishful engineer knows F#. Maybe, next year, Santa can make an online form that wouldn&rsquo;t accept anything but valid code. For now, it&rsquo;s the duty of Mrs. Cloud to read every letter and convert it to a list of records. Here is a sample:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">let</span> wishes = [
    { Recipient = Person <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Kelsey&#34;</span> ; Resource = Kubernetes (Nodes 25) }
    { Recipient = Person <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Jeff&#34;</span>   ; Resource = Serverless DotNet }
    { Recipient = Person <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Satoshi&#34;</span>; Resource = Blockchain Public }
]</code></pre></div>
<p>The value <code>wishes</code> is a strongly-typed list of records. Each record has multiple properties and utilizes &ldquo;algebraic data types&rdquo;: each type would have a label (&ldquo;Kubernetes&rdquo;) and an associated piece of data (25 nodes). The shape of data depends on the label: it&rsquo;s not possible to ask 25 nodes of serverless.</p>

<p>When the list is defined and compiled, it goes to production. But first, we need to assign an elf to each item in the list.</p>

<h3 id="elves">Elves</h3>

<p>All-powerful craftselves are represented as another F# type: a function type.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">type</span> <span style="color:#2b91af">Elf</span> = Wish -&gt; (<span style="color:#2b91af">unit</span> -&gt; Identifier) option</code></pre></div>
<p>Here is what it tells us:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a function which expects a <code>Wish</code> as an input parameter</li>
<li>It may return nothing if this elf can&rsquo;t fulfill the wish (represented by <code>option</code> type)</li>
<li>If it returns something, it returns yet another function&mdash;of type <code>unit -&gt; Identifier</code></li>
<li>This resulting function has a side effect (it accepts <code>unit</code>): the production of a cloud resource</li>
<li>It returns an <code>Identifier</code> of that resource</li>
</ul>

<p>Whoa, that&rsquo;s a lot of information conveyed by a single-line type definition!</p>

<p>In our program, each elf is a function, for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">let</span> aws (wish: Wish) =
    <span style="color:#00f">match</span> wish.Resource <span style="color:#00f">with</span>
    | Kubernetes k8s -&gt; makeEksCluster k8s |&gt; Some
    | Serverless s8s -&gt; makeAwsLambda s8s  |&gt; Some
    <span style="color:#008000">//|  ... more resource types
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>    | _ -&gt; None</code></pre></div>
<p>The function matches the type of the desired resource and calls a corresponding resource provisioning routine.</p>

<h3 id="resource-provisioning">Resource provisioning</h3>

<p>Pulumi handles the creation of cloud resources with its .NET SDKs spanning across all major cloud providers.</p>

<p>Here is a snippet which defines an Azure Function App:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">let</span> makeFunctionApp (Person name) (runtime: Runtime) () =
    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> app =
        FunctionApp(name,
            FunctionAppArgs
               (ResourceGroupName = io resourceGroup.Name,
                AppSettings = inputMap [<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;runtime&#34;</span>, runtime.ToString() |&gt; input],
                StorageConnectionString = io storageAccount.PrimaryConnectionString,
                Version = input <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;~2&#34;</span>))
    Url app.DefaultHostname</code></pre></div>
<p>And here is a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">let</span> makeGkeCluster (Person name) (Nodes nodeCount) () =
    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> masterVersion = input <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;1.15.1&#34;</span>
    <span style="color:#00f">let</span> cluster =
        Cluster(name,
            ClusterArgs
               (InitialNodeCount = input nodeCount,
                MinMasterVersion = masterVersion,
                NodeVersion = masterVersion,
                NodeConfig = input (
                    ClusterNodeConfigArgs
                       (MachineType = input <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;n1-standard-1&#34;</span>))))
    Url cluster.Endpoint</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="production">Production</h3>

<p>For a nice personal touch, a card needs to be printed, gift-wrapped, and delivered by Santa and reindeers. Programming the reindeers is for another blog post. For now, we just return a list of tuples of person names and resource URLs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">let</span> send (responses: Response <span style="color:#2b91af">list</span>) =

    |&gt; List.map (<span style="color:#00f">fun</span> (Person name, Url url) -&gt; name, url)
    |&gt; dict</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, another line combines the steps into the workflow:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span style="color:#00f">let</span> santaCloud () = wishes |&gt; (List.map fulfill) |&gt; send</code></pre></div>
<p>And the last line defines the entry point of the application:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp">[&lt;EntryPoint&gt;]
<span style="color:#00f">let</span> main _ = Deployment.run santaCloud</code></pre></div>
<p>Running the program produces an output like this:</p>

<p>Honestly, the system is brand-new this year, so we still need to see how it plays out on Christmas Eve. Regardless, we learned a thing or two today:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Types</strong>: F# has an excellent type system that allows expressing domain terms concisely and precisely.</li>
<li><strong>Logic</strong>: The program workflow is expressed in terms of function calls, pattern matching, and collections manipulation.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: Cloud resources are defined in F# with Pulumi .NET SDK, which supports pretty much any resource in any cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Application</strong>: Blended together, these components enable writing expressive, cohesive, maintainable, cloud-native applications using familiar and loved tools and practices.</li>
</ul>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Factors to consider while deploying cloud infrastructure for serverless apps.</blockquote>

<p>Function-as-a-Service solutions, such as AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, are a great way to build modern, scalable, and affordable cloud-native applications. By delegating routine work to cloud providers, serverless applications focus on custom logic to provide the ultimate business value. But, in fact, serverless is more than cloud functions. It&rsquo;s storage, HTTP gateways, databases, queues, monitoring, and security&mdash;and your serverless applications are likely to use multiple managed services and consist of many moving parts.</p>

<p>So how do you deploy such applications reliably? There are multiple cloud deployment tools out there! In this article, I identify several criteria to consider when making your decision.</p>

<h2 id="point-and-click-or-write-code">Point-and-Click or Write Code?</h2>

<p>Most tutorials and getting-started guides use web portals, like AWS Management Console or Microsoft Azure portal, to create basic serverless applications and required infrastructure. The visual flow of solutions like these is simple for newcomers to understand, and they can take shortcuts and assume some sensible defaults to streamline the process.</p>

<p>However, simply clicking through the online wizard won&rsquo;t produce reliable outcomes. Two weeks later, for example, you might not be able to follow the exact same sequence of steps to create a copy of your application when you need it. Now imagine if your colleague has to try!</p>

<p>Instead of the manual provisioning process, you can define the infrastructure as code. I&rsquo;m using â€œcodeâ€ in a broad sense here: It can be any machine-readable format that is written by a human and executed by an automated tool.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend using the infrastructure-as-code approach for any application that&rsquo;s beyond simple demos and one-off trials. Put the code definition to the source control, and you&rsquo;ll get repeatable deployments, documentation, a history of changes, and reference materials&mdash;all in one step.</p>

<h2 id="procedural-or-desired-state">Procedural or Desired State?</h2>

<p>Bash or PowerShell scripts are the traditional way to automate. Every cloud provider has a command-line interface (CLI) to manage its resource portfolio, so it&rsquo;s entirely possible to script the provisioning of the entire infrastructure for your serverless application.</p>

<p>However, there are a few downsides to this approach. Naturally, scripts are very imperative: You describe the exact steps to execute, in the required order. And if you need to change the state of an existing environment, you&rsquo;ll likely need to manage update scripts that bring the infrastructure through transition steps. Finally, it&rsquo;s hard to manage failures: If a script fails in the middle, the exact state of your resources will often be unknown.</p>

<p>You can also try the declarative style of Desired State Configuration (DSC). The goal of DSC is to describe the complete state of the infrastructure, regardless of its current state. Then, it functions as an automated tool which reads the desired state, compares it to the current state, and figures out which steps to execute to reconcile the two.</p>

<p>All the tools that I mention in the rest of the article follow the desired-state philosophy.</p>

<h2 id="cloud-vendor-or-third-party">Cloud Vendor or Third Party?</h2>

<p>Each cloud vendor has its own native tool to manage infrastructure as code: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/template-deployment-overview">Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/">Google Cloud Deployment Manager</a>, for example. These are all first-class services, so they have excellent feature coverage and are widely used, stable, and battle-tested.</p>

<p>However, while the vendor tools are robust, they have a set of constraints. Obviously, each tool focuses on one cloud, so mastering CloudFormation won&rsquo;t make you an ARM guru. Also, the deployment managers are fundamental infrastructure components of their respective clouds. Because they need to support every service and feature, they tend to operate at a quite low level. Additionally, they must avoid breaking changes, so legacy features and issues tend to pile up over time. The tools may feel rigid, and because they are closed source and vendor managed, you don&rsquo;t have much influence.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that numerous third-party infrastructure management tools try to compete with cloud vendors, and serverless apps can successfully use many of them. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">HashiCorp&rsquo;s Terraform</a>, for example, is a cross-provider tool, which covers not only the majority of each cloud&rsquo;s features, but also the configuration of Kubernetes, Docker images, Kafka, monitoring tools, and some databases.</p>

<p>The downside of third-party tools is that they may not offer support for some cloud features. For example, while using Terraform&rsquo;s AzureRM provider, I definitely bumped into missing features, especially for newer services or niche configurations. To compensate for these kinds of issues, third-party tools are usually open source and accept contributions, so an active community is an essential factor.</p>

<h2 id="execution-on-the-client-or-in-the-cloud">Execution on the Client or in the Cloud?</h2>

<p>Cloud vendor tools take your definition files and run them from within the managed cloud service. For example, Azure creates a first-class object&mdash;deployment&mdash;which shows the deployed resources or problems that occurred. CloudFormation can automatically roll back a failed deployment to the previous well-known state.</p>

<p>In contrast, CLI scripts, Terraform, and <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a> run the deployment from the client machine where they are executed, or, even better, from CI/CD servers for most production deployments. This means they have more granular control over the execution flow and error handling, but also that they aren&rsquo;t able to reuse the built-in deployment features of the native-cloud managers.</p>

<p>Some tools, like <a href="https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere">Troposphere</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/">AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)</a>, and <a href="https://serverless.com/">Serverless Framework</a>, have their own way to describe the infrastructure. Still, they transpile these definitions to formats like CloudFormation to make use of the cloud deployment engines.</p>

<h2 id="general-purpose-or-specialized">General Purpose or Specialized?</h2>

<p>CloudFormation, ARM templates, and Terraform are all general-purpose tools: You can define serverless applications with them, but that&rsquo;s not their primary focus. Traditional infrastructure and networking solutions still have a far larger audience, so these scenarios attract more attention from the vendors. General-purpose tools lack higher-level abstractions, so the resource definitions tend to be verbose and repetitive.</p>

<p>Instead of general-purpose tools, you can use a specialized solution that is inherently modeled around the concepts of serverless. Serverless Framework is a multi-provider tool, while <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/">AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)</a> is a comparable option from AWS. Another example is Claudia.js&mdash;a deployment tool for node-based AWS Lambda.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get started with specialized tools, and to use them for implementing basic scenarios. However, if your application is a combination of serverless features and traditional infrastructure, you may need to use more than one tool. In this case, make sure that the benefits of the specialized tools are enough to compensate for the complexity of using multiple options simultaneously.</p>

<p>I struggled with trying to use Serverless Framework for Azure: The experience was not ideal, and some features were missing. Understandably, AWS is Serverless Framework&rsquo;s primary target, so plugins targeting other clouds may lag behind.</p>

<h2 id="markup-or-programming-language">Markup or Programming Language?</h2>

<p>If you settle for a desired-state configuration tool, you will likely use a markup language to define the cloud infrastructure. CloudFormation, Google Cloud Deployment Manager, and Serverless Framework use YAML, while ARM templates are defined in JSON. Terraform invented its own markup language called HCL. This language makes the definitions more succinct and expressive, but requires you to master a new language and toolchain.</p>

<p>However, markup languages are lacking expressiveness to easily represent conditional shapes, multiple similar resources, or higher-level abstractions. They embed home-grown constructs inside YAML or JSON, or make you fall back to template-based generation. A newer class of tools is trying to address this limitation by using general-purpose programming languages to define cloud infrastructures. For example, AWS CDK uses TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET to produce CloudFormation output.</p>

<p>Pulumi takes this idea even further by providing support for a similar set of languages to provision infrastructure for any cloud&mdash;and many tools beyond the cloud. Developers can use their existing skills and tools to define type-safe and testable infrastructure and to create higher level abstractions with classes, components, and functions.</p>

<p>Both Pulumi and AWS CDK have a set of components focusing on serverless applications, so they might be the best tools for providing both high-level expressive serverless components and low-level infrastructure resources, if needed.</p>

<p>In the past, I deployed Azure resources with templates containing five thousand lines of JSON. It wasn&rsquo;t a great developer experience to write all those lines, and the application was mostly a bunch of web servers and SQL databases&mdash;nothing too fancy. When I define a similar infrastructure with TypeScript, the code size reduction is at least tenfold. <a href="https://mikhail.io/2019/02/from-yaml-to-typescript-developers-view-on-cloud-automation/">This post</a> gives an example of a similar transformation for an AWS serverless app.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Serverless applications consist of many components, combining multiple managed services into one cohesive flow. Regardless of your preference for a specific tool, you should use the infrastructure-as-code approach to make your serverless applications reliable and maintainable in the long run.</p>

<p>Cloud infrastructure tools are evolving quickly, and none of them are perfect just yet. To choose what&rsquo;s best for you, evaluate your needs and constraints, compare several options, and keep an eye on the field: More innovations are coming soon.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>A comparison AWS Lambda with Azure Functions, focusing on their unique features and limitations.</blockquote>

<p>Forget about managing virtual machines or paying for idle hardware! Serverless compute brings unlimited scale and high availability to every company in the world, from small startups to multinational corporations. At least, thatâ€™s the vision of Amazon and Microsoft, todayâ€™s biggest cloud vendors.</p>

<p>AWS Lambda pioneered the Function as a Service (FaaS) application model in 2014. With Faas, a small piece of codeâ€”called a functionâ€”is deployed as a ZIP file and linked to a specific type of event, such as a queue or an HTTP endpoint. AWS runs this function every time a matching event occurs, be it once per day or a thousand times per second.</p>

<p>Since 2014, the serverless model has taken off, and every major cloud provider has introduced its flavor of an FaaS service: Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and IBM Cloud Functions, to name a few. While the basic idea behind all the offerings is the same, there are many differences between these implementations.</p>

<p>Today, Iâ€™ll compare AWS Lambda with Azure Functions (Lambdaâ€™s equivalent in Azure cloud), focusing on their unique features and limitations. Here are the ten major differences between the two options.</p>

<h2 id="1-hosting-plans">1. Hosting Plans</h2>

<p>To put it simply, there is one way to run a serverless function in AWS: deploy it to the AWS Lambda service. Amazonâ€™s strategy here is to make sure that this service covers as many customer scenarios as possible, ranging from hobby websites to enterprise-grade data processing systems.</p>

<p>Microsoft takes a different approach. They separated the notion of the Azure Functions programming model from the serverless operational model. With Azure Functions, I can deploy my functions to a pay-per-use, fully-managed Consumption plan. However, I can also use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale">other hosting options</a> to run the same code:</p>

<ul>
<li>App Service plan: provides a predictable pay-per-hour price, but has limited auto-scaling behavior</li>
<li>Premium plan (preview): gives reserved capacity <em>and</em> elastic scaling, combined with advanced networking options, for a higher price</li>
<li>A Docker container: can run anywhere on self-managed infrastructure</li>
<li>Kubernetes-based event-driven architecture (KEDA, experimental): brings functions to Kubernetes, running in any cloud or on-premises</li>
</ul>

<p>The Consumption plan has the lowest management overhead and no fixed-cost component, which makes it the most serverless hosting option on the list. For that reason, Iâ€™m going to focus on AWS Lambda vs. Azure Functions Consumption plan for the rest of this article.</p>

<h2 id="2-configurability">2. Configurability</h2>

<p>When deploying <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/resource-model.html">an AWS Lambda function</a>, I need to define the maximum memory allocation, which has to be between 128MB and 3GB. The CPU power and cost of running the function are proportional to the allocated memory. It takes a bit of experimentation to define the optimal size, depending on the workload profile. Regardless of size, all instances run on Amazon Linux.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Azure Functions Consumption plan is one-size-fits-all. It comes with 1.5GB of memory and one low-profile virtual core. You can choose between Windows and Linux as a host operating system.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-premium-plan#plan-and-sku-settings">Azure Functions Premium plan</a> comes with multiple instance sizes, up to 14GB of memory, and four vCPUs. However, you have to pay a fixed per-hour fee for the reserved capacity.</p>

<h2 id="3-programming-languages">3. Programming Languages</h2>

<p>AWS Lambda natively supports JavaScript, Java, Python, Go, C#, F#, PowerShell, and Ruby code.</p>

<p>Azure Functions has runtimes for JavaScript, Java, Python, C#, F#, and PowerShell (preview). Azure lacks Go and Rubyâ€”otherwise, the language options are very similar.</p>

<h2 id="4-programming-models">4. Programming Models</h2>

<p>Specifics vary between runtimes, but, overall, AWS Lambda has a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-services.html">straightforward programming model</a>. A function receives a JSON object as input and may return another JSON as output. The event type defines the schema of those objects, which are documented and defined in language SDKs.</p>

<p>Azure Functions has a more sophisticated model based on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings">triggers and bindings</a>. A trigger is an event that the function listens to. The function may have any number of input and output bindings to pull and/or push extra data at the time of processing. For example, an HTTP-triggered function can also read a document from Azure Cosmos DB and send a queue message, all done declaratively via binding configuration.</p>

<p>The implementation details differ per language runtime. The binding system provides extra flexibility, but it also brings some complexity, in terms of both API and configuration.</p>

<h2 id="5-extensibility">5. Extensibility</h2>

<p>One drawback of all FaaS services on the market is the limited set of supported event types. For example, if you want to trigger your functions from a Kafka topic, you are out of luck on both AWS and Azure.</p>

<p>Other aspects of serverless functions are more customizable. AWS Lambda defines a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html">concept of layers</a>: a distribution mechanism for libraries, custom runtimes to support other languages, and other dependencies.</p>

<p>Azure Functions enables open <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/wiki/Binding-Extensions-Overview">binding extensions</a> so that the community can create new types of bindings and bring them into Function Apps.</p>

<h2 id="6-concurrency-and-isolation">6. Concurrency and Isolation</h2>

<p>Both services can run multiple (potentially thousands) executions of the same function simultaneously, each handling one incoming event.</p>

<p>AWS Lambda always reserves a separate instance for a single execution. Each execution has its exclusive pool of memory and CPU cycles. Therefore, the performance is entirely predictable and stable.</p>

<p>Azure Functions allocates multiple concurrent executions to the same virtual node. If one execution is idle waiting for a response from the network, other executions may use resources which would otherwise be wasted. However, resource-hungry executions may fight for the pool of shared resources, harming the overall performance and processing time.</p>

<h2 id="7-cost">7. Cost</h2>

<p>Serverless pricing is based on a pay-per-usage model. Both services have two cost components: pay-per-call and pay-per-GB*seconds. The latter is a metric combining execution time and consumed memory.</p>

<p>Moreover, the price tag for both services is almost exactly the same: $0.20 per million requests and $16 per million GB*seconds ($16.67 for AWS). One million executions running for 100 ms each and consuming 1GB of memory cost less than $2. Since AWS Lambda was the first on the market, I assume Microsoft just copied the numbers.</p>

<p>There are some differences in the details, though:</p>

<ul>
<li>AWS Lambda charges for full provisioned memory capacity, while Azure Functions measures the actual average memory consumption of executions.</li>
<li>If Azure Functionâ€™s executions share the instance, the memory cost isnâ€™t charged multiple times, but shared between executions, which may lead to noticeable reductions.</li>
<li>Both services charge for at least 100 ms and 128MB for each execution. AWS rounds the time up to the nearest 100 ms, while Azure rounds up to 1 ms.</li>
<li>CPU profiles are different for Lambda and Functions, which may lead to different durations for comparable workloads.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wrote more on how to measure the cost of Azure Functions <a href="https://mikhail.io/2019/08/how-to-measure-the-cost-of-azure-functions/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="8-http-integration">8. HTTP Integration</h2>

<p>AWS Lambda used to require Amazon API Gateway to listen to HTTP traffic, which came at a massive additional cost. Recently, Amazon introduced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/alb-can-now-invoke-lambda-functions-to-serve-https-requests/">integration with Elastic Load Balancing</a>, which may be more cost efficient for high-load scenarios. However, the pricing is per hour, so good judgment is required.</p>

<p>Azure Functions comes with HTTP endpoint integration out of the box, and there is no additional cost for this integration.</p>

<h2 id="9-performance-and-scalability">9. Performance and Scalability</h2>

<p>AWS Lambda has been on the market longer than Azure Functions, and has a laser focus on the single-hosting model. Although there are no established industry-wide benchmarks, many claim that AWS Lambda is better for rapid scale-out and handling massive workloads, both for web APIs and queue-based applications. The bootstrapping delay effectâ€”cold startsâ€”are also less significant with Lambda.</p>

<p>Azure Functions has improved significantly in the last year or two, but Microsoft is still playing catch-up.</p>

<h2 id="10-orchestrations">10. Orchestrations</h2>

<p>Serverless functions are nanoservices: small blocks of code doing just one thing. The question of how to build large applications and systems out of those tiny pieces is still open, but some composition patterns already exist.</p>

<p>Both AWS and Azure have dedicated services for workflow orchestration: AWS Step Functions and Azure Logic Apps. Quite often, functions are used as steps in those workflows, allowing them to stay independent but still solve significant tasks.</p>

<p>In addition, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview">Azure Durable Functions</a> is a library that brings workflow orchestration abstractions to code. It comes with several patterns to combine multiple serverless functions into stateful long-running flows. The library handles communication and state management robustly and transparently, while keeping the API surface simple.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-should-you-choose">So, What Should You Choose?</h2>

<p>AWS Lambda and Azure Functions are similar services, but the devil is in the detailsâ€”and virtually every angle shows some essential distinctions between the two. My list of ten differences is certainly not exhaustive, and each aspect would need a separate article to cover it in full.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s unlikely that your choice will be driven purely by these differences. At the same time, whenever you have to choose one option over the other, or when <a href="https://www.iamondemand.com/blog/azure-user-heres-what-you-must-know-about-aws/">you switch between providers</a>, itâ€™s crucial to adjust your thinking and practices to match the peculiarities.</p>

<p>In short, choose the option that fits you best!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Hosting Azure Functions in Kubernetes: how it works and the simplest way to get started.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Azure Functions</strong> is a managed service for serverless applications in the Azure cloud. More broadly, Azure Functions is a runtime with multiple hosting possibilities. <strong>KEDA</strong> (<a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2019/05/06/announcing-keda-kubernetes-event-driven-autoscaling-containers/">Kubernetes-based Event-Driven Autoscaling</a>) is an emerging option to host this runtime in <strong>Kubernetes</strong>.</p>

<p>In the first part of this post, I compare KEDA with cloud-based scaling and outline the required components. In the second part, I define infrastructure as code to deploy a sample KEDA application to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.</p>

<p>The result is a fully working example and a high-level idea of how it works. Kubernetes expertise is not required!</p>

<h2 id="autoscaling-primer">Autoscaling Primer</h2>

<p>When you deploy an Azure Function, it runs within the Azure Functions runtime. The runtime is a host process which knows how to pull events from an <strong>event source</strong> (defined by the function trigger) and pass those to your function:</p>

<p><img src="runtime.png" alt="Azure Functions Runtime" /></p>

<p>However, one instance of runtime rarely provides adequate processing capacity. If you only get one message per day, having an instance always running is wasteful. If you get thousands of events per second, one instance wonâ€™t be able to process all of them.</p>

<p>Automatic <strong>horizontal scaling</strong> solves the problem. At any point in time, several identical <strong>workers</strong> are crunching the events. The number N is optimized continuously to fit the current workload by adding new workers and removing underutilized ones.</p>

<figure >
    
        <img src="idea.png"
            alt="Components of an automatically scaled application"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Components of an automatically scaled application</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p><strong>Instance Provisioner</strong> is an extra component in the auto-scaled system. It monitors the stream of metrics from the event source and decides to add or remove workers. A massive standby pool of idle generic workers provides the workforce. Such a generic worker pulls the <strong>artifact</strong> of the assigned function, plugs it into the runtime, and starts processing events.</p>

<h2 id="azure-functions-consumption-plan">Azure Functions Consumption Plan</h2>

<p><strong>Consumption Plan</strong> is the serverless hosting option where Azure manages all the scaling components internally. Letâ€™s consider an example of an Azure Function triggered by a <strong>Storage Queue</strong>:</p>

<figure >
    
        <img src="functionapp.png"
            alt="Azure Functions Consumption Plan"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Azure Functions Consumption Plan</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The deployment artifact is just the code packaged as a zip archive and uploaded to Blob Storage. <strong>Scale Controller</strong> is an internal Azure component that observes the target queue and allocates Function App instances based on the queue length fluctuations. Each instance bootstraps itself with a zip file, connects to the queue, and pulls messages to process.</p>

<p>The cloud provider manages all the components of the system, so developers can focus on writing business logic code. It can be <a href="/2019/08/ten-pearls-with-azure-functions-in-pulumi/">as simple as a JavaScript callback</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts">queue.onEvent(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;MyHandler&#34;</span>, async (context, msg) =&gt; {
   console.log(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;New message: &#34;</span> + JSON.stringify(msg));
});</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="keda">KEDA</h2>

<p>Over the last few years, Kubernetes has gained traction across many industries. KEDA is provides a way to design and run event-driven applications inside a Kubernetes cluster. KEDA implements the autoscaling components in terms of Kubernetes tools.</p>

<p>The target Function App is packaged together with the Azure Functions runtime into a custom <strong>Docker image</strong> and published to a <strong>registry</strong>. A Kubernetes <strong>deployment</strong> utilizes that image and configures the parameters to connect it to the target event source (for instance, a queue):</p>

<p><img src="k8s-deployment.png" alt="Kubernetes Deployment" /></p>

<p>The application can then run on one or many instances, or <strong>pods</strong> in Kubernetes terms. Kubernetes has a built-in component to scale out the pods: <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/">Horizontal Pod Autoscaler</a> (HPA). By default, HPA makes scaling decisions based on the processor utilization of existing pods. CPU turns out to be a poor metric for event-driven applications: many workloads are not CPU-bound, so the scale-out wonâ€™t be aggressive enough to keep the queue empty. Therefore, KEDA introduces a <strong>ScaledObject</strong>&mdash;a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/">custom resource</a> which pulls metric values from the event source and feeds them as a custom metric to HPA:</p>

<figure >
    
        <img src="keda.png"
            alt="Kubernetes-based Event-Driven Autoscaling"
             />
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Kubernetes-based Event-Driven Autoscaling</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>At the time of the initial KEDA preview announcement and until Kubernetes version 1.16, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler wasnâ€™t able to scale a deployment down to zero pods. Therefore, KEDA includes an extra controller to disable the deployment if the event source is empty and re-enable it when new events come in. This duty might be delegated back to HPA in the future versions.</p>

<p>Now, when we know what KEDA is and how it works, itâ€™s time to deploy a Function App!</p>

<h2 id="deploy-a-function-app-with-keda-and-pulumi">Deploy a Function App with KEDA and Pulumi</h2>

<p>Here is the list of the components required to run a Function App in Kubernetes with KEDA:</p>

<ul>
<li>Azure Kubernetes Service cluster</li>
<li>Azure Container Registry</li>
<li>Helm chart keda-edge with KEDA service and custom resource definition</li>
<li>Azure Storage Queue as a sample event source</li>
<li>Docker image of the queue processor application</li>
<li>Deployment of this image</li>
<li>Scaled Object custom resource</li>
</ul>

<p>All these components can be defined and deployed within a single Pulumi program. Below I highlight the main blocks of the program. Navigate to the <a href="#reusable-components">following section</a> to look at a short and reusable component.</p>

<h3 id="aks-cluster">AKS Cluster</h3>

<p>KEDA can run on any Kubernetes cluster, but I choose to do so on managed AKS. My custom <code>AksCluster</code> component defines a cluster, including the required Active Directory and networking configuration. It makes multiple assumptions, so I only need to specify the main properties:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> resourceGroup = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.core.ResourceGroup(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;keda-sample&#34;</span>);

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> aks = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> AksCluster(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;keda-cluster&#34;</span>, {
    resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
    kubernetesVersion: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;1.13.5&#34;</span>,
    vmSize: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Standard_B2s&#34;</span>,
    vmCount: <span style="color:#2b91af">3</span>,
});</code></pre></div>
<p><code>aks.cluster</code> now has all the required output values, for instance, <code>aks.cluster.kubeConfigRaw</code> configuration.</p>

<h3 id="shared-cluster-components">Shared Cluster Components</h3>

<p>The next group of components needs to be deployed just once.</p>

<p>Azure Container Registry is not part of the AKS cluster. Its purpose is to host Docker images of applications.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> registry = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.containerservice.Registry(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;registry&#34;</span>, {
    resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">args.resourceGroup.name</span>,
    adminEnabled: <span style="color:#2b91af">true</span>,
    sku: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Premium&#34;</span>,
});</code></pre></div>
<p>A Helm chart <code>kedacore/keda-edge</code> deploys the KEDA service and the <code>ScaledObject</code> custom resource definition.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> keda = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> k8s.helm.v2.Chart(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;keda-edge&#34;</span>, {
    repo: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;kedacore&#34;</span>,
    chart: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;keda-edge&#34;</span>,
    version: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;0.0.1-2019.07.24.21.37.42-8ffd9a3&#34;</span>,
    values: {
        logLevel: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;debug&#34;</span>,
    },
}, { providers: { kubernetes: <span style="color:#2b91af">aks.provider</span> } });</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="event-source">Event Source</h3>

<p>KEDA supports multiple types of event sources, and the current list is available <a href="https://github.com/kedacore/keda#event-sources-and-scalers">here</a>. An event source is supported if there is a scaler which knows how to pull metrics out of it and turn them into a custom metric for HPA.</p>

<p>My example uses an Azure Storage Queue as the event source:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> storageAccount = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.storage.Account(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;kedasa&#34;</span>, {
    resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
    accountTier: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Standard&#34;</span>,
    accountReplicationType: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;LRS&#34;</span>,
});

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> queue = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.storage.Queue(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;kedaqueue&#34;</span>, {
    storageAccountName: <span style="color:#2b91af">storageAccount.name</span>,
});</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="docker-image">Docker Image</h3>

<p>The same Pulumi program is capable of building a Docker image and uploading it to the Container Registry.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> dockerImage = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> docker.Image(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;image&#34;</span>, {
    imageName: <span style="color:#2b91af">pulumi.interpolate</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>registry.loginServer<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">/</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>args.queue.name<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">:v1.0.0`</span>,
    build: {
        context: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;./functionapp&#34;</span>,
    },
    registry: {
        server: <span style="color:#2b91af">registry.loginServer</span>,
        username: <span style="color:#2b91af">registry.adminUsername</span>,
        password: <span style="color:#2b91af">registry.adminPassword</span>,
    },
});</code></pre></div>
<p>The image refers to the folder with a <code>Dockerfile</code> in it and uses the <code>registry</code> variables to fill the credentials.</p>

<h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>

<p>Now, we can define a Deployment which uses the Docker image to run our Function App on Kubernetes pods.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> appLabels = { app: <span style="color:#2b91af">name</span> };
<span style="color:#00f">const</span> deployment = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> k8s.apps.v1.Deployment(name, {
    apiVersion: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;apps/v1&#34;</span>,
    kind: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Deployment&#34;</span>,
    metadata: {
        labels: <span style="color:#2b91af">appLabels</span>,
    },
    spec: {
        selector: { matchLabels: <span style="color:#2b91af">appLabels</span> },
        template: {
            metadata: {
                labels: <span style="color:#2b91af">appLabels</span>,
            },
            spec: {
                containers: [{
                    name,
                    image: <span style="color:#2b91af">dockerImage.imageName</span>,
                    env: [{ name: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;queuename&#34;</span>, value: <span style="color:#2b91af">args.queue.name</span> }],
                    envFrom: [{ secretRef: {name: <span style="color:#2b91af">secretQueue.metadata.name</span> } }],
                }],
                imagePullSecrets: [{ name: <span style="color:#2b91af">args.service.registrySecretName</span> }],
            },
        },
    },
}, { provider: <span style="color:#2b91af">aks.provider</span> });</code></pre></div>
<p>The deployment refers to the secret value which stores the connection string to our target Storage Queue:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> secretQueue = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> k8s.core.v1.Secret(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;queue-secret&#34;</span>, {
    data: {
        queueConnectionString:
            <span style="color:#2b91af">args.storageAccount.primaryConnectionString.apply</span>(c =&gt; Buffer.from(c).toString(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;base64&#34;</span>)),
    },
}, { provider: <span style="color:#2b91af">aks.provider</span> });</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="scaled-object">Scaled Object</h3>

<p>Finally, we need to deploy an instance of the <code>ScaledObject</code> custom resource, which takes care of feeding the metrics from the queue to the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> scaledObject = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> k8s.apiextensions.CustomResource(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;scaledobject&#34;</span>, {

    kind: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;ScaledObject&#34;</span>,
    metadata: {
        labels: { deploymentName: <span style="color:#2b91af">name</span> },
    },
    spec: {
        scaleTargetRef: { deploymentName: <span style="color:#2b91af">name</span> },
        triggers: [{
            type: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;azure-queue&#34;</span>,
            metadata: {
                type: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;queueTrigger&#34;</span>,
                connection: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;queueConnectionString&#34;</span>,
                queueName: <span style="color:#2b91af">args.queue.name</span>,
                name: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;myQueueItem&#34;</span>,
            },
        }],
    },
}, { provider: <span style="color:#2b91af">aks.provider</span> });</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="reusable-components">Reusable Components</h2>

<p>We can simplify the program further by creating reusable Pulumi components for a Cluster, a Service, and a Function app. After those are done, here is all the code required to deploy a Kubernetes cluster with a Function App and KEDA.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>As of October 2019, the KEDA project is still in the experimental phase and should not be used for any production applications. Also, if the managed version of Azure Functions suits your needs, you should probably stick to that service. It requires less effort, provides high-level primitives, and enables unlimited elastic scaling.</p>

<p>However, if your company is betting on Kubernetes as the standard application platform, but you still see high value in event-driven fine-grained applications, KEDA might be an exciting option for the future.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>A reusable component to build highly-available, low-latency applications on Azure</blockquote><p>In a <a href="/2019/07/globally-distributed-serverless-application-in-100-lines-of-code/">previous blog post</a>, I shared how easy it is to create a globally distributed, highly-available, low-latency application with Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, and Pulumi.</p>

<p>Today, I want to show how the same approach can be generalized for any cloud compute service, including containers, virtual machines, and serverless functions.</p>

<h2 id="e-commerce-example">E-commerce Example</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s consider an example of an e-commerce website which targets a worldwide audience. The architecture of such a website should address several challenges.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-teams">Multiple Teams</h3>

<p>A large e-commerce website is a sophisticated software application and consists of many subcomponents. Many engineers in multiple teams work on it simultaneously.</p>

<p>A typical approach is to organize engineers into smaller teams and make each team autonomous and responsible for one or several business domains. This strategy leads to microservices architecture when the application is built out of loosely coupled components. Each component represents a &ldquo;vertical slice&rdquo;: a team owns functionality across the vertical stack, from its user interface and service API to the data storage layer and underlying infrastructure.</p>

<p>Here is an example of such a breakdown:</p>

<p><img src="website.png" alt="Multiple components on a single web page" /></p>

<figcaption>
    <h4>
        Multiple components on a single web page
    </h4>
</figcaption>

<h3 id="diversity-of-technology-decisions">Diversity of Technology Decisions</h3>

<p>One of the guiding principles of microservices architecture is that each team makes decisions regarding which tools and technologies to use. They are free to choose programming languages, databases, or cloud services that are the best fit for the service. In practice, some restrictions do apply&mdash;for instance, the teams might need to share the same cloud provider.</p>

<p>In our hypothetical example, the whole product is hosted on Azure cloud, however other aspects differ:</p>

<ul>
<li>Product Page team runs JavaScript serverless functions and stores data in a document database</li>
<li>Shopping Cart team uses C# and .NET Core, packages the code in a Docker container, and uses event sourcing to store every action ever made by users while shopping</li>
<li>Pricing Engine team has a mix of Java and C++ code with a bunch of third-party libraries and deploys the services to Ubuntu VMs that use MongoDB drivers for storage</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="global-presence">Global Presence</h3>

<p>Regardless of the tech, the user-facing services must serve customers across the globe and serve them fast. This requirement demands a geo-distributed infrastructure so that user requests could be handled by the nearest data center to minimize the latency and ensure excellent user experience.</p>

<p>Each team has to solve the following problems in a way which fits their tech stack:</p>

<ul>
<li>Distribute the data across the globe</li>
<li>Run their compute workload in each region next to the data</li>
<li>Manage all this infrastructure in a reliable way</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&rsquo;s consider these goals and possible solutions.</p>

<h2 id="azure-cosmos-db">Azure Cosmos DB</h2>

<p>Distributing data across many data centers while keeping them consistent and available is one of the hardest problems in computer science and engineering. Delegating this challenge to a specialized service or product is usually a sensible idea.</p>

<p>Azure Cosmos DB is the database of choice for global applications running in the Azure cloud. Cosmos DB provides a turn-key global distribution to any number of regions worldwide. Regions can be added or removed along the way while running production workloads and without having any impact on high availability. The accounts can be provisioned with a single write region or in multi-master mode with every region being writable, thus enabling writes that are local to each region.</p>

        <div class="article-post">

<p>Cosmos DB supports multiple models of data: key-value, document, column family, graph, with wire-protocol compatible APIs for MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, SQL, etcd, Gremlin, etc. It also supports multiple well-defined and practical consistency levels, from eventual to strong consistency, so that each application can strike the right balance between latency, availability, and consistency guarantees. All of this is offered as a fully-managed service, with the comprehensive SLAs covering latency, throughput, consistency, and 99.999% high availability for both reads and writes.</p>

<p>Sounds great, but how do we build applications to leverage this power?</p>

<h2 id="distributed-web-applications">Distributed Web Applications</h2>

<p>In contrast to Cosmos accounts, compute services in Azure are located in a single region. This holds true for Virtual Machines, Container Instances, Serverless Functions, and managed Azure Kubernetes Service.</p>

<p>If an application is deployed to a single location, we are not making good use of geographic redundancy of the database. If a user happens to be far from the application region, their request has to travel across the globe. Moreover, the application connects to the nearest region of Cosmos DB, while all other regions stay idle:</p>

<p>Instead, we should deploy a copy of application infrastructure to each of the target regions:</p>

        <div class="article-post">

<p>Each application instance has to be configured to connect to the endpoint of the Cosmos DB in the same region to enjoy local single-digit-milliseconds latency for reads and writes.</p>

<p>While beneficial to end-users, such setup brings much extra complexity in terms of infrastructure management:</p>

<ul>
<li>Application regions must stay in sync with Cosmos DB regions, including the correct configuration of preferred locations.</li>
<li>With the growth of the number of regions, the traditional capacity planning gets harder and harder. This makes a dynamic auto-scaling configuration increasingly important.</li>
<li>A central routing service must be configured to flow the traffic from end-users to the closest application instance.</li>
<li>Each team must execute all these tasks, independently but coherently.</li>
</ul>

<p>Letâ€™s see how infrastructure as code and a general-purpose programming language come to the rescue.</p>

<h2 id="search-for-a-reusable-abstraction">Search for a Reusable Abstraction</h2>

<p>In our example, three teams have a common goal of providing high-quality service to customers around the world, but they differ in the compute services they want to use.</p>

<p>Product Card team relies on serverless functions, so their infrastructure may look like this:</p>

<p><img src="functions.png" alt="Global application with Azure Functions" /></p>

<figcaption>
    <h4>
        Global application with Azure Functions
    </h4>
</figcaption>

<p>Shopping Cart team packages their code as a Docker container, which they put into Azure Container Registry, and then use Azure Container Instances to run the application. The Registry is a global Azure resource, while Container Instances are deployed separately per region.</p>

<p><img src="containers.png" alt="Global application with Azure Container Instances" /></p>

<figcaption>
    <h4>
        Global application with Azure Container Instances
    </h4>
</figcaption>

<p>Pricing Engine team runs their code on Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), so they have a task of creating Virtual Machine images, and then deploying those to an Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set, fronting it with a Load Balancer, and configuring all the networking infrastructure including Virtual Networks, Subnets, Public IPs, Network Security Groups, etc. Once again, this has to be done for each location independently.</p>

<p><img src="vmscalesets.png" alt="Global application with Virtual Machines" /></p>

<figcaption>
    <h4>
        Global application with Virtual Machines
    </h4>
</figcaption>

<p>Each team has the same global structure of infrastructure, including a Traffic Manager front-end and a Cosmos DB data store. At the same time, the per-region compute infrastructure differs substantially.</p>

<p>Instead of copying the common pieces of infrastructure between the teams, we can think of a reusable abstraction which could be shared by every service.</p>

<p><img src="globalapp.png" alt="Global application pattern" /></p>

<figcaption>
    <h4>
        Global application pattern
    </h4>
</figcaption>

<p>For this blog post, I created a custom Pulumi component called CosmosApp which implements such abstraction and simplifies the provisioning of global web applications. The component creates distributed Cosmos DB resources, as well as the front-end routing component, while allowing pluggable compute layer implementation.</p>

<h2 id="cosmos-app-with-azure-functions">Cosmos App with Azure Functions</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example of how the component can be used. Creating a globally-distributed application requires three steps:</p>

<h3 id="list-the-regions">List the Regions</h3>

<p>We define a configuration value to contain a comma-separated list of Azure regions that weâ€™ll deploy the application to.</p>

<pre><code>$ pulumi config set locations WestUS,WestEurope,SouthEastAsia,SouthBrazil,AustraliaCentral
</code></pre>

<p>This value can be loaded and parsed into a JavaScript array:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> locations = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> pulumi.Config().require(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;locations&#34;</span>).split(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;,&#34;</span>);</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="build-a-region-template">Build a Region Template</h3>

<p>We define a factory function to create the infrastructure in each location. Its signature is a bit unusual in that we return a function from another function. I&rsquo;ll explain the motivation in the next example. For now, it&rsquo;s important to understand the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>We get a Cosmos account and a location as input arguments</li>
<li>We create a Function App in the specified location with connection settings pointing to the local Cosmos DB replica</li>
<li>We return the identifier of the Function App so that a Traffic Manager endpoint could point to it</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">function</span> buildProductApp({ cosmosAccount }: GlobalContext) {
    <span style="color:#00f">return</span> ({ location }: RegionalContext) =&gt; {
        <span style="color:#00f">const</span> app = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.ArchiveFunctionApp(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;function-app&#34;</span>, {
            resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
            location,
            archive: <span style="color:#2b91af">new</span> pulumi.asset.FileArchive(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;./app&#34;</span>),
            appSettings: {
                COSMOSDB_ENDPOINT: <span style="color:#2b91af">cosmosAccount.endpoint</span>,
                COSMOSDB_KEY: <span style="color:#2b91af">cosmosAccount.primaryMasterKey</span>,
                COSMOSDB_LOCATION: <span style="color:#2b91af">location</span>,
            },
        });

        <span style="color:#00f">return</span> {
            id: <span style="color:#2b91af">app.functionApp.id</span>,
        };
    };
}</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="instantiate-a-cosmos-app">Instantiate a Cosmos App</h3>

<p>Finally, we use the <code>buildProductApp</code> factory function to create the geo-distributed application:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> products = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> CosmosApp(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;products&#34;</span>, {
    resourceGroup,
    locations,
    databaseName: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;productsdb&#34;</span>,
    containerName: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;products&#34;</span>,
    factory: <span style="color:#2b91af">buildProductApp</span>,
});</code></pre></div>
<p>[ <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-cosmosapp-component/functionApp.ts">Full Example</a> ]</p>

<h2 id="cosmos-app-with-container-instances">Cosmos App with Container Instances</h2>

<p>The Shopping Cart team will have to follow the same steps but define their compute infrastructure accordingly.</p>

<p>A significant difference to the Functions-based example is the fact that the Container-based application needs some infrastructure to be shared across regions. The top block of the factory function defines an instance of Azure Container Registry, builds a Docker image, and puts that image into the Registry:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">function</span> buildShoppingCartApp({ cosmosAccount, database, container }: GlobalContext) {

    <span style="color:#00f">const</span> registry = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.containerservice.Registry(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;global&#34;</span>, {
        resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
        adminEnabled: <span style="color:#2b91af">true</span>,
        sku: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Premium&#34;</span>,
    }, opts);

    <span style="color:#00f">const</span> dockerImage = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> docker.Image(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;node-app&#34;</span>, {
        imageName: <span style="color:#2b91af">pulumi.interpolate</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>registry.loginServer<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">/mynodeapp:v1.0.0`</span>,
        build: {
            context: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;./container&#34;</span>,
        },
        registry: {
            server: <span style="color:#2b91af">registry.loginServer</span>,
            username: <span style="color:#2b91af">registry.adminUsername</span>,
            password: <span style="color:#2b91af">registry.adminPassword</span>,
        },
    });

    <span style="color:#00f">return</span> ({ location }: RegionalContext) =&gt; {
        <span style="color:#008000">// ... see the next sample
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>    };
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, the factory function that builds per-region infrastructure can directly reference the Registry and the image to deploy an Azure Container Instances group. Note how <code>registry</code> and <code>dockerImage</code> are used as any other TypeScript variable inside the closure factory function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">function</span> buildShoppingCartApp({ cosmosAccount, database, container }: GlobalContext) {

    <span style="color:#00f">const</span> registry = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.containerservice.Registry(<span style="color:#008000">/* ... */</span>);
    <span style="color:#00f">const</span> dockerImage = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> docker.Image(<span style="color:#008000">/* ... */</span>);

    <span style="color:#00f">return</span> ({ location }: RegionalContext) =&gt; {
        <span style="color:#00f">const</span> group = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.containerservice.Group(<span style="color:#a31515">`aci-</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>location<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span>, {

                    environmentVariables: {

    };
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, a <code>CosmosApp</code> is defined:</p>

<p>Shopping Cart workload expects both reads and writes from the end-users, so the team decides to enable multi-master support in their Cosmos DB instance.</p>

<p>The Pricing Engine team has to go through the same steps but employ IaaS-based infrastructure to run application code. The factory function creates a dozen resources related to virtual machines, load balancing, networking, and auto-scaling. You may define as many resources as needed in the code, as long as it returns a pointer to the proper resource to link the endpoint.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Azure Cloud Platform offers an amazing array of capabilities for application developers. Azure Cosmos DB takes care of distributing the data globally, reliably, consistently, and with low-latency access anywhere around the world. Nonetheless, developers still need to take care of adequately provisioning the application layer for efficiently serving users around the globe.</p>

<p>Cosmos App component is an excellent example of the power of using a general-purpose programming language to define cloud infrastructure. Such a component can let you codify the best practices and let multiple teams or companies share the implementation. The component and applications can evolve independently, with tools like versioning, package managers, compilers, and automated tests helping to maintain high-quality standards.</p>]]></content>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>How to monitor your APIs using serverless technologies and an Epsagon dashboard.</blockquote>

<p>The modern software world runs on application programming interfaces, otherwise known as APIs. There is an API for everything: charging a credit card, sending an email, finding an address on a map, or hailing a taxi.</p>

<p>Likewise, the huge computing power of the cloud is entirely accessible via multiple layers of programming interfaces, including HTTP services and language-specific SDKs. Cloud vendors such as AWS have thousands of endpoints available to every developer in the world and modern businesses ought to embrace these existing services to stay productive. Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, businesses should focus on the core values and differentiators for their specific market and simply purchase, adopt and reuse the remaining services required from third parties that have proven themselves in their given niche.</p>

<p>This principle stands at the core of the philosophy behind serverless architecture: focus on the crucial bits. Serverless tech has a low barrier of entry and was designed with the intention to require little boilerplate code to use. This helps to explain why so many reliable <a href="https://epsagon.com/blog/the-importance-and-impact-of-apis-in-serverless/">APIs are an inherent part</a> of serverless applications today. Lambda functions, for their part, are used by developers as the glue between cloud services and internal as well as external API calls.</p>

<h2 id="role-of-performance">Role of Performance</h2>

<p>One thing to keep in mind when adopting APIs, in general, is performance. Most API calls are usually synchronous requests over HTTP or HTTPS. They may be fast to execute, but they may also be slow and responsiveness is not manifested in the API definition itself. Moreover, the latency may vary over time, as APIs can crash at seemingly random intervals or under higher loads. Throttling strategies might also kick in once the workload passes a given threshold.</p>

<p>This aspect of performance is arguably more decisive in the serverless world than ever before, as slow downstream APs for serverless platforms have numerous implications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each Lambda function has a maximum duration threshold and it&rsquo;s going to time out and fail if the total duration of API calls goes above that value.</li>
<li>AWS charges organizations for execution times for Lambda invocations. Even when a function is idle while waiting for the HTTP response, you pay for each 100 milliseconds consumed. Slow API calls lead to the inevitable <a href="https://epsagon.com/blog/how-much-does-aws-lambda-cost/">extra cost of the serverless application</a>.</li>
<li>For synchronous invocations, when a user is waiting for the Lambda to complete, substantial slowdowns lead to poor user experience, as unhappy customers and lose time, and often, revenue.</li>
</ul>

<p>Luckily, a lot can be done to prevent and mitigate such issues.</p>

<h2 id="instrumenting-api-performance">Instrumenting API Performance</h2>

<p>There are several strategies to assess the impact that the performance of a third-party API has on your serverless application.</p>

<p>While just getting started with a new API, it makes sense to research if the supplier has provided a performance SLA or not. Regardless of the answer, the next step is to execute the target calls and measure the latency profile. You should strive to do so well in advance, before signing up for a new service. Finally, it&rsquo;s worth running a load test to emulate your target workload over an extended period.</p>

<p>Your job is still not done even after an application is successfully deployed to production. For any non-trivial application, it&rsquo;s worth investing in monitoring tools and best practices. A monitoring toolkit provides both real-time and historical perspectives on the performance of your dependencies as well as their impact on application usability and cost.</p>

<p>The following section gives a sneak peek of such activities.</p>

<h2 id="example-geo-alerting-application">Example: Geo-Alerting Application</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s consider a sample application that processes telemetry from connected vehicles. Each vehicle sends periodic messages, which end up in the AWS cloud. A single AWS Lambda receives a message and executes the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Decodes the payload and extracts data, including geo-coordinates and sensor values.</li>
<li>Reverse geocodes the coordinates to infer the address with a call to the <a href="https://geocode.xyz/">xyz</a> service.</li>
<li>Saves a log entry containing the message properties and addresses to an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">AWS DynamoDB</a>.</li>
<li>Compares the values against thresholds to check whether to send an alert.</li>
<li>If needed, loads a suitable email template from an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS S3</a> bucket.</li>
<li>Sends an email notification using the <a href="https://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a> mailing service.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s a reasonably straightforward application and yet it depends on four external APIs: two AWS services and two third-party endpoints. Here, we will implement a prototype of such an application and link it to an <a href="https://epsagon.com/">Epsagon</a> dashboard to see what kind of insights we can get about its performance.</p>

<h2 id="timeline-of-a-single-invocation">Timeline of a Single Invocation</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by calling my AWS Lambda once, then find that invocation in the Epsagon dashboard and display the <a href="https://epsagon.com/blog/introducing-the-timeline-view/">timeline view</a>:</p>

<p><img src="timeline.png" alt="The Epsagon dashboard: A Timeline view of a single call." /></p>

<figcaption><h4>The Epsagon dashboard: A Timeline view of a single call.</h4></figcaption>

<p>You can see that this single invocation took 827 milliseconds to complete and that this time was entirely spent on waiting for the API calls to complete. You can also clearly see the breakdown of the execution time between the four dependencies and that the geocoding and email sending is slower than the calls to DynamoDB and S3.</p>

<p>The timeline view looks very familiar to any developer who has ever worked with performance and network tabs as part of a browser&rsquo;s developer tools. And it&rsquo;s beneficial for a similar purpose: hunting down the culprit of slow execution.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that you don&rsquo;t have to track the calls manually. All the data is collected automatically by the Epsagon library once you plug it into the Lambda.</p>

<h2 id="tracking-invocations-over-time">Tracking Invocations Over Time</h2>

<p>The above was just one measurement, which might not be very representative of reality. The next step is to see how the target AWS Lambda behaves over time. Let&rsquo;s set up a test to execute the function several hundred times over several minutes. It&rsquo;s easiest to use AWS API Gateway and invoke the function via HTTP. Alternatively, you could use an SQS queue or another asynchronous trigger, but monitoring behaves similarly in all cases.</p>

<p>After the test, go ahead and navigate to the Architecture Map page:</p>

<p><img src="architecturemap.png" alt="Architecture Map - Epsagon dashboard." /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Architecture Map - Epsagon dashboard.</h4></figcaption>

<p>The preceding Epsagon dashboard gives you an aggregate view of all recent function executions. In this case, the numbers happen to be quite similar to the previous test: about 800 milliseconds of invocation time on average with geocoding being the slowest call. SendGrid calls seem to go faster on average, but the red border around it indicates that some of the requests failed. This also points to a potential problem, which you would need to investigate. You may want to take some concrete actions based on the collected data, such as trying another geocoding service to see if it is faster for a comparable price.</p>

<p>You can estimate the cost of your application based on the predicted number of invocations multiplied by the price for 900 milliseconds of execution time. This function spends all the time waiting for I/O operations to complete and it&rsquo;s not CPU- or memory-heavy. Therefore, it makes sense to provision smaller sizes of AWS Lambda instances.</p>

<p>Finally, you may want to break down your &ldquo;monolith&rdquo; function into multiple functions that are interconnected with queues. Smaller single-purpose functions <a href="https://epsagon.com/blog/the-right-way-to-distribute-messages-effectively-in-serverless-applications/">have several benefits</a>, including higher resilience and potentially lower cost.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Almost every serverless function relies on one or many API calls and a combination of other cloud services and third-party applications. The latency and stability of those calls directly affect the Lambda function, both in terms of performance and cost.</p>

<p>Be sure to test the performance of any newly adopted API before relying on it. In addition, you need to monitor the latency, reliability and <a href="https://epsagon.com/blog/finding-serverless-hidden-costs/">cost of the API calls in production</a>. It is important that you optimize the structure of your application to avoid long-running calls on the synchronous path that is observable by end-users. And for better cost manageability and higher resilience, complete the executions as fast as possible and delegate the remaining work to queue- or event-based functions.</p>

<h2 id="function-app-deployment">Function App Deployment</h2>

<p>Azure Functions can be written in many languages, and Pulumi supports whatever choice you make. You can take any existing serverless application and deploy it using infrastructure-as-code.</p>

<h3 id="1-deploy-a-net-function-app">1. Deploy a .NET Function App</h3>

<p>[ <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-functions-raw">Runnable Example</a> ]</p>

<p>Many Function Apps are .NET applications created with native tooling like Visual Studio or the Functions CLI. Pulumi can simply deploy such an application in only a few lines of JavaScript:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> dotnetApp = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.ArchiveFunctionApp(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;http-dotnet&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   archive: <span style="color:#2b91af">new</span> pulumi.asset.FileArchive(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;./app/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/publish&#34;</span>),
   appSettings: { runtime: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;dotnet&#34;</span> },
});</code></pre></div>
<p>There are only four things required:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Function App name (&ldquo;http-dotnet&rdquo;)</li>
<li>the resource group it belongs to</li>
<li>the path to the compiled .NET assemblies, and</li>
<li>the desired runtime</li>
</ul>

<p>Pulumi takes care of the rest for you. It handles the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating a Storage Account and a Blob Container</li>
<li>Zipping up the binaries and uploading them to the blob container</li>
<li>Calculating a SAS token</li>
<li>Preparing a Consumption Plan and a Function App using this Consumption Plan</li>
<li>Configuring the required application settings, including a reference to the zip archive with the SAS token</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="console.png" alt="Serverless Application deployed by Pulumi" /></p>

<p>While a few values are required, you are not restricted to the default behavior and can change any setting.</p>

<h3 id="2-run-functions-using-an-elastic-premium-plan">2. Run Functions using an Elastic Premium Plan</h3>

<p>While the Consumption Plan is the ultimate serverless option, there are other ways to host Azure Functions. Azure also offers the Premium Plan: a combination of the power and guarantees of a fixed App Service Plan with the elasticity of Consumption.</p>

<p>If you want to take advantage of a Premium Plan, go ahead and define it as a Pulumi resource, then link to it in the Function App definition:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> premiumPlan = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.Plan(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;my-premium&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   sku: {
       tier: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Premium&#34;</span>,
       size: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;EP1&#34;</span>,
   },
   maximumElasticWorkerCount: <span style="color:#2b91af">20</span>,
});

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> javaApp = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.ArchiveFunctionApp(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;http-java&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   plan: <span style="color:#2b91af">premiumPlan</span>,
   archive: <span style="color:#2b91af">new</span> pulumi.asset.FileArchive(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;./java/target/functions/fabrikam&#34;</span>),
   appSettings: { runtime: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;java&#34;</span> },
});</code></pre></div>
<p>In this example, I deployed a Java application. The Premium Plan has a couple of configuration knobs: the <em>instance size</em> and the <em>maximum scale-out limit</em>.</p>

<h2 id="http-functions-as-callbacks">HTTP Functions as Callbacks</h2>

<p>Node.js is another runtime supported by Azure Functions. Like before, you can use the <code>ArchiveFunctionApp</code> class to deploy the application from an external folder. However, Pulumi&rsquo;s Node.js SDK provides a way to mix the code of your functions directly into your infrastructure definition.</p>

<h3 id="3-define-node-js-functions-as-inline-callbacks">3. Define Node.js Functions as Inline Callbacks</h3>

<p>[ <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-functions">Runnable Example</a> ]</p>

<p>A TypeScript or a JavaScript function becomes an Azure Function deployed to the cloud:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> greeting = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.HttpEventSubscription(<span style="color:#a31515">&#39;greeting&#39;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   callback: <span style="color:#2b91af">async</span> (context, req) =&gt; {
       <span style="color:#00f">return</span> {
           status: <span style="color:#2b91af">200</span>,
           body: <span style="color:#a31515">`Hello </span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>req.query[<span style="color:#a31515">&#39;name&#39;</span>] || <span style="color:#a31515">&#39;World&#39;</span><span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">!`</span>,
       };
   }

<p>You are free to use any NPM module inside the callback, and the dependencies will be automatically packaged into the deployment artifact. Alternatively, you can extract the callback function into a separate file or package and import it from your infrastructure code.</p>

<p>While mixing infrastructure and application code in the same file may seem counterintuitive, it provides many benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Combined code binaries (data plane) and infrastructure (control plane) as a single unit of deployment</li>
<li>Eliminate the need for boilerplate configuration like <code>host.json</code> and <code>function.json</code> files</li>
<li>Robust typing out-of-the-box: For instance, you can flawlessly &ldquo;dot into&rdquo; the <code>content</code> and <code>req</code> object above.</li>
</ul>

<p>The previous example deployed a Function App with a single Function. However, Azure supports applications with multiple Functions bundled together.</p>

<h3 id="4-rest-apis-as-multiple-functions">4. REST APIs as Multiple Functions</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s common to use Azure Functions for implementing RESTful APIs. As an API may consist of multiple endpoints, we may need to combine several HTTP Functions into a single deployment unit.</p>

<p>To achieve that, we define an <code>HttpFunction</code> object per Azure Function, each with its callback and settings. Then, we pass an array of these objects into a <code>MultiCallbackFunctionApp</code> constructor. Each Function definition may have a specific route and HTTP methods to handle:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> get = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.HttpFunction(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Read&#34;</span>, {

<p>You can combine as many Functions as you want, including functions of different types, as shown in the next example.</p>

<h3 id="5-function-warming-with-a-timer-function">5. Function &ldquo;Warming&rdquo; with a Timer Function</h3>

<p>[ <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure/blob/master/examples/http-multi">Runnable Example</a> ]</p>

<p>Scheduled jobs are another frequent use case for serverless functions. It&rsquo;s possible to define a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-timer#cron-expressions"><em>cron expression</em></a> and get the code executed at designated intervals.</p>

<p>The Consumption Plan disposes a worker if no Function runs in about 20 minutes. After disposal, the next execution will cause a <a href="https://mikhail.io/serverless/coldstarts/define/"><em>cold start</em></a>, and the response latency, will increase.</p>

<p>In order to avoid this disposal, we can combine a target HTTP Function with a Timer Function. The body of the Timer Function is empty, since its sole purpose is to trigger the Function App and keep the worker &ldquo;warm&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> warmer = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.TimerFunction(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;warmer&#34;</span>, {

   callback: <span style="color:#2b91af">async</span> () =&gt; {},
});

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> http = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.HttpFunction(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;hello&#34;</span>, {
   callback: <span style="color:#2b91af">async</span> (context, req) =&gt; {
       <span style="color:#00f">return</span> {
           status: <span style="color:#2b91af">200</span>,
           body: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Hello World!&#34;</span>,
       };
   }
});

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> app = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.MultiCallbackFunctionApp(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;always-warm-app&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   functions: [http, warmer],
});</code></pre></div>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to imagine a custom component <code>WarmedFunctionApp</code> which appends a standard Timer Function to an array of Functions passed to its constructor.</p>

<h2 id="cloud-event-handling">Cloud Event Handling</h2>

<p>While HTTP is a widespread use case, Azure Functions support many other trigger types too. <a href="https://mikhail.io/2019/05/serverless-as-simple-callbacks-with-pulumi-and-azure-functions/">The previous post</a> featured Storage Queues and ServiceBus Topics. Pulumi supports Timers, Events Hubs, Event Grid, Storage Blobs, Service Bus Queues, and Cosmos DB Change Feed events, too! Let&rsquo;s see how that looks using Azure Event Hubs.</p>

<h3 id="6-process-events-from-azure-event-hubs">6. Process Events from Azure Event Hubs</h3>

<p>[ <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure/tree/master/examples/eventhub">Runnable Example</a> ]</p>

<p>Azure Event Hubs is a fully-managed log-based messaging service comparable to Apache Kafka. In contrast to a self-hosted Kafka cluster, it only takes a few lines of JavaScript to create an Event Hub and start processing events:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> eventHub = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> eventhub.EventHub(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;my-hub&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   namespaceName: <span style="color:#2b91af">namespace.name</span>,
   partitionCount: <span style="color:#2b91af">2</span>,
   messageRetention: <span style="color:#2b91af">7</span>,
});

eventHub.onEvent(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;MyHubEvent&#34;</span>, async (context, msg) =&gt; {
   console.log(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Event Hub message: &#34;</span> + JSON.stringify(msg));
});</code></pre></div>
<p>Every time a new event comes in, be it once per hour or a thousand times a second, the Function is executed. Azure manages the scale-out for you.</p>

<h3 id="7-subscribe-to-azure-event-grid">7. Subscribe to Azure Event Grid</h3>

<p>[ <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure/blob/master/examples/eventgrid">Runnable Example</a> ]</p>

<p>Azure Event Grid is another trigger type for Azure Functions. It is a dispatcher service for distributing events from many other Azure services as well as external data sources.</p>

<p>A classic example is subscribing to events from Azure Blob Storage. The Event Grid subscription connects to a given Storage Account and provides several handy options to filter the event stream. The following example subscribes to all JPG files created in any container of the account:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> storageAccount = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.storage.Account(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;eventgridsa&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   accountReplicationType: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;LRS&#34;</span>,
   accountTier: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Standard&#34;</span>,
   accountKind: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;StorageV2&#34;</span>,
});

azure.eventgrid.events.onGridBlobCreated(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;OnNewBlob&#34;</span>, {
   storageAccount,
   subjectFilter: {
       caseSensitive: <span style="color:#2b91af">false</span>,
       subjectEndsWith: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;.jpg&#34;</span>,
   },
   callback: <span style="color:#2b91af">async</span> (context, event) =&gt; {
       context.log(<span style="color:#a31515">`Subject: </span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>event.subject<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span>);
       context.log(<span style="color:#a31515">`File size: </span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>event.data.contentLength<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span>);
   },
});</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>event</code> object is strongly typed: The snippet above logs the file size, but there are many other properties at your disposal. Code completion makes the discovery process painless.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that Pulumi does much of the work behind the scenes here, allowing you to focus on the important parts of the task at hand. In particular, Pulumi retrieves the appropriate secret key from Azure Functions ARM API and creates an Event Grid subscription which points to a specific webhook containing that key.</p>

<h3 id="8-respond-to-resource-level-events">8. Respond to Resource-level Events</h3>

<p>[ <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure/blob/master/examples/eventgrid">Runnable Example</a> ]</p>

<p>Here is a good illustration of the power of Event Grid. A callback function gets triggered for each change to any resource belonging to the target Resource Group:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> resourceGroup = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.core.ResourceGroup(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;eventgrid-rg&#34;</span>);

eventgrid.events.onResourceGroupEvent(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;OnResourceChange&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   callback: <span style="color:#2b91af">async</span> (context, event) =&gt; {
       context.log(<span style="color:#a31515">`Subject: </span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>event.subject<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span>);
       context.log(<span style="color:#a31515">`Event Type: </span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>event.eventType<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span>);
       context.log(<span style="color:#a31515">`Data: </span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>JSON.stringify(event.data)<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span>);
   },
});</code></pre></div>
<p>This simple piece of code is an easy launching point for many automation, auditing, and governance scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="data-flows-with-function-bindings">Data Flows with Function Bindings</h2>

<p>Azure Functions come with a powerful system of bindings. So far, we only saw examples of using event sources as trigger bindings. However, Azure also supports a powerful set of so called &ldquo;input&rdquo; and &ldquo;output&rdquo; bindings.</p>

<h3 id="9-output-bindings">9. Output Bindings</h3>

<p>[ <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure/blob/master/examples/queue">Runnable Example</a> ]</p>

<p>Output bindings enable developers to easily forward the data from an Azure Function to an arbitrary destination in a declarative manner. For instance, if a queue handler needs to send a message to another queue, we don&rsquo;t have to use cloud SDKs. Instead, we can return the message-to-be-sent from the callback and wire it to the output queue. Here is a quick example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> incoming = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.storage.Queue(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;queue-in&#34;</span>, {
  storageAccountName: <span style="color:#2b91af">storageAccount.name</span>,
});

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> outgoing = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.storage.Queue(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;queue-out&#34;</span>, {
   storageAccountName: <span style="color:#2b91af">storageAccount.name</span>,
});

incoming.onEvent(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;NewMessage&#34;</span>,  {
   outputs: [outgoing.output(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;queueOut&#34;</span>)],
   callback: <span style="color:#2b91af">async</span> (context, person) =&gt; {
       <span style="color:#00f">return</span> {
           queueOut: <span style="color:#a31515">`</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>person.name<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515"> logged into the system`</span>,
       };
   },
});</code></pre></div>
<p>Two elements play together here:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>outputs</code> property defines an output binding with the name <code>queueOut</code> and the destination to <code>outgoing</code></li>
<li>The <code>queueOut</code> property of the resulting object contains the output message</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the binding name must match the output property.</p>

<h3 id="10-input-bindings">10. Input Bindings</h3>

<p>[ <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure/tree/master/examples/table">Runnable Example</a> ]</p>

<p>Input bindings pull extra bits of information and pass them as input parameters to the callback. The exact usage depends on the trigger and binding types and might be tricky to get right with JSON configuration files. Here is one example of wiring done in a Pulumi program:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> values = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.storage.Table(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;values&#34;</span>, {
   storageAccountName: <span style="color:#2b91af">storageAccount.name</span>,
});

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> getFunc = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.HttpEventSubscription(<span style="color:#a31515">&#39;get-value&#39;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   route: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;{key}&#34;</span>,
   inputs: [
       values.input(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;entry&#34;</span>, { partitionKey: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;lookup&#34;</span>, rowKey: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;{key}&#34;</span> }),
   ],
   callback: <span style="color:#2b91af">async</span> (context, request, entry) =&gt; {
       <span style="color:#00f">return</span> {
           status: <span style="color:#2b91af">200</span>,
           body: <span style="color:#2b91af">entry.value</span>,
       };
   },
});</code></pre></div>
<p>There are three crucial bits here:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>route</code> property of this HTTP Function contains a template parameter <code>key</code>. The runtime extracts the actual <code>key</code> value from the HTTP request.</li>
<li>The <code>inputs</code> option contains a reference to a Storage Table with a hardcoded <code>partitionKey</code> and a <code>rowKey</code> bound to the <code>key</code> template parameter. At execution time, a row is retrieved based on the combination of the keys. The entry, if found, is passed to the callback.</li>
<li>The <code>callback</code> has three input parameters, while all previous examples had two. The third parameter contains the retrieved row.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to have multiple input and output bindings, and any combination of those.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just released an update to the <a href="/serverless/coldstarts/">Serverless Cold Starts</a> section of my website. The most significant change to the previous dataset seems to be in how AWS treats idle instances of AWS Lambda.</p>

<p>Cold starts are expensive, so all cloud providers preserve a warm instance of a cloud function even when the application is idle. If the function stays unused for an extended period, such idle instance might eventually be recycled.</p>

<p>Azure Functions recycles its instances after 20 minutes of idling. Google Cloud Functions has no fixed value, but most often, instances may survive several hours of inactivity. The policy of AWS Lambda has recently changed.</p>

<h2 id="pre-july-between-25-and-60-minutes">Pre-July: between 25 and 60 minutes</h2>

<p>The behavior of AWS Lambda used to look a bit random: an average idle instance would typically survive between 25 and 60 minutes:</p>

<p>This chart plots the response duration (Y-axis) by the interval since the previous requests (X-axis). Each point represents a single request in the dataset. Blue points are cold starts, and red points are responses from warm instances.</p>

<p>While some cold starts happen after 10 minutes or so, many instances survive up to 1 hour.</p>

<h2 id="post-july-the-fixed-lifespan-of-10-minutes">Post-July: the fixed lifespan of 10 minutes</h2>

<p>There is no ambiguity anymore: every instance lives for precisely 10 minutes after the last request.</p>

<p>This behavior is similar to Azure Functions, but the value is two times shorter: 10 minutes for AWS versus 20 minutes for Azure.</p>

<h2 id="month-over-month-view">Month-over-month view</h2>

<p>I broke down the data set by month and calculated the periods when an idle instance is recycled with 10%, 50%, and 90% probabilities. Here is the chart that I produced, the higher line means the higher duration of survival:</p>





  







<script type="text/javascript">
addChart((data, options) => {
  data.addColumn('string', 'Time');

  const points = [{"items":[["March",29],["April",28],["May",29],["June",21],["July",11],["August",10]],"name":"90% survive"},{"items":[["March",44],["April",44],["May",46],["June",37],["July",15],["August",10]],"name":"50% survive"},{"items":[["March",59],["April",59],["May",60],["June",58],["July",16],["August",11]],"name":"10% survive"}];
  const seriesCount = points.length;
  for (var j = 0; j < seriesCount; j++) {
    data.addColumn('number', points[j].name);
  }

  const rows = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < points[0].items.length; i++)
  {
    const item = [points[0].items[i][0]];
    for (var j = 0; j < seriesCount; j++) {
      item.push(points[j].items[i][1]);
    }
    rows.push(item);
  }

  data.addRows(rows);
  console.debug(rows);
  options.lineWidth = 3;
  options.hAxis = {
    title: '2019 by month'
  };
  options.vAxis = {
    title: 'minutes',
    maxValue: 1.0

  options.legend = { position: 'top' };
  options.series = [{"color":"green"},{"color":"yellow"},{"color":"red"}];
  return new google.visualization.AreaChart(document.getElementById('chart_div_aws-lambda-10-minutes\/interval_history'));

<p>Once again, we can see how the broader range of probabilistic lifespans collapsed into the deterministic 10-minute threshold.</p>

<h2 id="practical-takeaway">Practical Takeaway</h2>

<p>Applications with infrequent invocations running in AWS Lambda might experience more cold starts compared to pre-July time.</p>

<p>Cold starts are a major perceived pain point of serverless services. While cloud providers are fighting the cold starts on many fronts, it&rsquo;s interesting to see a change in AWS Lambda, which seemingly goes the opposite direction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the predictability of a fixed lifespan makes the keep-it-warm workarounds more reliable. Whenever you feel a cold start might be a problem for your Lambda, you might want to issue a warm-up request every 5 minutes. You can find an example of doing so in a structured way in <a href="/2018/08/aws-lambda-warmer-as-pulumi-component/">AWS Lambda Warmer as Pulumi Component</a>.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Azure pricing can be complicatedâ€”to get the most value out of your cloud platform, you need to know how to track spend and measure the costs incurred by Azure Functions.</blockquote>

<p>Azure Functions can be hosted in multiple ways: there&rsquo;s an App Service plan with a fixed cost per hour, a new Premium plan with both fixed and variable price components, not to mention self-managed options based on container technologies. Instead of any of those three, this article focuses on Consumption plan&mdash;the classic serverless offering billed purely based on the actual usage.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-serverless-different">How Is Serverless Different?</h2>

<p>Serverless Functions have three important properties, each of them having a significant impact on the way we deal with the cost of an application:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Low management overhead</strong>: the cloud provider manages the service. The total cost of ownership is minimal: developers create code to solve business problems&mdash;the rest is taken care of.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Pay-per-use</strong>: Functions are charged per actual executions. Nothing is reserved in advance, so the cost of running a Function App grows linearly with the application demand.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Elastically scalable</strong>: when a Function is idle, Azure scales the infrastructure down to zero with no associated cost. Whenever the workload grows, Azure brings enough capacity to serve all the demand.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?</h4>

<p>In the past, the cost of infrastructure running an application and the value that the application provides were separated. A company would run multiple applications, each having numerous components and services, on a shared infrastructure of dedicated hardware, a pool of VMs, or IaaS services in the cloud. It&rsquo;s quite complicated to tear the expenses apart and determine the exact cost of each application, let alone a particular component. Moreover, the investments are planned and executed in advance, so the infrastructure can&rsquo;t follow the elasticity of workload and ends up overprovisioned and underutilized.</p>

<p>Today, the application portfolio can run on serverless functions, each component becoming a separate Function App. In turn, each App may contain multiple functions. Since the company pays per actual use, they can understand and manage the exact cost of each component.</p>

<p>This ability enables the business to:</p>

<ul>
<li>See which features are most profitable, and which ones are too expensive;</li>
<li>Optimize the Functions that have high impact on the invoice and ignore the rest;</li>
<li>Make informed decisions of whether to spend engineering time on such optimizations or create new business value while paying a premium to the cloud provider.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the cost information is retrospective: the actual numbers come after the fact of spending. The lack of budgeting makes decision makers nervous: they are used to plan the cost of infrastructure long in advance. Therefore, our goal is to understand the cost structure and be able to predict the changes in invoices as applications and business evolve.</p>

<h2 id="billing-model-of-the-consumption-plan">Billing Model of the Consumption Plan</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dissect the structure of the Consumption plan. There are two core components of the cost of serverless Functions in Azure: <strong>Execution Count</strong> and <strong>Execution Time</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Execution Count</em> is straightforward. Each Function defines a trigger&mdash;an event which causes the code to execute. It can be an incoming HTTP request or a message in a given queue. Every call counts: you get charged $0.20 per million executions. This component of the cost can be substantially reduced if you batch events: process several events in a single execution.</p>

<p>The second cost component is called <em>Execution Time</em> on the pricing page, which isn&rsquo;t exactly correct: it depends on both completion time and memory consumption and is metered in <em>GB-seconds</em>. You pay $16 per million GB-seconds. That is, if a Function runs 1 million times, it always consumes 1 GB of memory and completes in 1 second, you pay $16.</p>

<p>The memory consumption is always rounded up to the next 128 MB, and the minimum time charge is 100 milliseconds. Therefore, the minimal time charge is again $0.20 per million executions.</p>

<p>Holistically, there are other cost components of running serverless applications not tied directly to the Azure Functions service: I&rsquo;ll briefly touch on those at the end of the article.</p>

<h2 id="azure-bill-and-cost-analysis">Azure Bill and Cost Analysis</h2>

<p>The prominent place to see the cost of operating Azure Functions is the monthly bill. Open the Azure portal and navigate to your subscription&rsquo;s page, choose <em>Invoices</em> and then a period to look at. Here is a sample report from a subscription of mine:</p>

<p><img src="invoiced-units.png" alt="Consumed Function Units on an Azure invoice" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Consumed Function Units on an Azure invoice</h4></figcaption>

<p>You should be able to see the incurred change for the two metrics we discussed above: <em>Total Executions</em> and <em>Execution Time</em> (the metric in GB-seconds).</p>

<p>With <em>Cost Analysis</em> tool, you can see the billing data at per day granularity. Depending on your analysis goal, you might need more details than that. For instance, you may wonder how the cost is spread over periods within a day or be able to predict the future cost based on short trials before the application (or its newer version) goes into production.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see how to dig deeper into the details.</p>

<h2 id="azure-monitor-metrics">Azure Monitor Metrics</h2>

<p><strong>Azure Monitor</strong> is a service for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from applications running in the Azure cloud. While mostly focusing on performance, it also collects some useful data related to service consumption.</p>

<p>Azure Functions issue two cost-related metrics into Azure Monitor: <em>Function Execution Count</em> and <em>Function Execution Units</em>. Each metric emits a value once every minute.</p>

<p>To see these metrics in the Azure portal, navigate to the <em>Monitor</em> service and select the <em>Metrics</em> item on the left. Click <em>Select a Resource</em> button and find the Function App that you want to investigate. Note that the <em>Resource Type</em> should be set to <em>App Service</em>: there&rsquo;s no value called <em>Function App</em> in that dropdown.</p>

<p>Select <em>Function Execution Count</em> in the Metrics dropdown, <em>Sum</em> as the aggregation type, and adjust the period selector as needed. You should now see a chart similar to this one:</p>

<p><img src="monitor-execution-count.png" alt="Function Execution Count in Azure Monitor" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Function Execution Count in Azure Monitor</h4></figcaption>

<p>In this particular case, there were about 4,940 executions in the last 30 minutes. You can view the stats per minute; in this example, all the executions come from a single spike&mdash;something that I might want to investigate.</p>

<p>Now, switch the metric to <em>Function Execution Units</em>. Alternatively, you can add it to the same chart, but the scale of the two metrics is so different that you won&rsquo;t be able to see both lines at the same time:</p>

<p><img src="monitor-execution-units.png" alt="Function Execution Units in Azure Monitor" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Function Execution Units in Azure Monitor</h4></figcaption>

<p>The value conversion gets a bit tricky here. The chart shows a total of 634.13 million <em>Function Execution Units</em> consumed in the last hour. These are not the GB-seconds mentioned above, though: the metric is nominated in MB-milliseconds. To convert this to GB-seconds, divide it by 1,024,000. So, in this case, my Function App consumed 634,130,000 / 1,024,000 = 619 GB-seconds in the last half-an-hour.</p>

<h2 id="sum-it-up">Sum It Up</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s estimate the monthly cost of the application based on the metrics above. We start with the  half-an-hour calculation:</p>

<pre><code>Execution Count = 4,940 * $0.20 / 1,000,000 = $0.000988
Execution Time = 634,130,000 / 1,024,000 * $16 / 1,000,000 = $0.009908
30 Min Total = Execution Count + Execution Time = $0.010896
</code></pre>

<p>If I keep the same average workload over a month, the cost is going to be:</p>

<pre><code>Monthly Cost = 30 Min Total * 2 * 24 * 30 = $15.69
</code></pre>

<p>My application costs about 2 cents an hour, or 15 bucks a month.</p>

<h2 id="dashboards">Dashboards</h2>

<p>If you only need to look at the data once, the <em>Metrics</em> screen above should be sufficient.</p>

<p>For continuous monitoring of the metrics, you can put the same charts onto your Azure Dashboard. On the same screen, Click <em>Pin to dashboard</em> button and then navigate to the <em>Dashboard</em> menu item of the portal. You should see your chart added:</p>

<p><img src="monitoring-dashboard.png" alt="Monitoring Dashboard" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Monitoring Dashboard</h4></figcaption>

<p>You might have several Function Apps to monitor at this point. You can either add a separate chart for each one of them, or add several lines to the same chart, or a combination of both. To customize the name of the dashboard item, click on the chart, edit the name, and click <em>Update Dashboard</em> button.</p>

<p>The dashboard has a period selector at the top, which allows changing the visible time interval of all charts on the fly&mdash;very handy to zoom in and zoom out to go from overview to a more nuanced view of the cost breakdown and back.</p>

<h2 id="api">API</h2>

<p>The user interface of the Azure portal is helpful, but you might want to integrate the data into other tools used in your organization. For that, you can still use metrics from Azure Monitor but retrieve the values programmatically. One way to do so is to request information from the REST API periodically. In the following template, replace the parameters in curly braces with your actual Azure resources:</p>

<pre><code>GET /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{function-app-name}/providers/microsoft.insights/metrics?api-version=2018-01-01&amp;metricnames=FunctionExecutionUnits,FunctionExecutionCount
Host: management.azure.com
Authorization: Bearer {access-token}
</code></pre>

<p>The access token can be obtained from the Azure Command Line Interface (CLI) with the command <code>az account get-access-token</code>.</p>

<p>By the way, you can also get the same metric values within the CLI itself:</p>

<pre><code>az monitor metrics list --resource /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{function-app-name} --metric FunctionExecutionUnits,FunctionExecutionCount --aggregation Total --interval PT1M
</code></pre>

<p>In both cases, you receive a JSON response with time series data. Here is a snippet to illustrate the most useful bits:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span style="">...</span>
<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;name&#34;</span><span style="">:</span> {
    &#34;localizedValue&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Function Execution Units&#34;</span>,
    &#34;value&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;FunctionExecutionUnits&#34;</span>
}<span style="">,</span>
<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;timeseries&#34;</span><span style="">:</span> [
{
    &#34;data&#34;: [
    {
        &#34;timeStamp&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;2019-07-05T10:23:00+00:00&#34;</span>,
        &#34;total&#34;: 127.0
    },
    {
        &#34;timeStamp&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;2019-07-05T10:24:00+00:00&#34;</span>,
        &#34;total&#34;: 34.1
    }
    <span style="">...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The reported time interval and granularity are adjustable with HTTP query and command parameters.</p>

<p>Please note that Azure Monitor has a retention period of 30 days, which is as far as you can go to observe the historical data. At the moment, I couldn&rsquo;t find a built-in capability to stream the Function App execution metrics into long-term storage. Therefore, to store a copy of the data, you need to implement the integration based on periodic calls to Metrics API and persist the response into the storage of your choice. Azure Table Storage could be one pragmatic solution for this purpose.</p>

<h2 id="application-insights-metrics">Application Insights Metrics</h2>

<p>Azure Monitor is a great tool in addition to observing the monthly bill. However, its resolution is still limited in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>It reports aggregated values with a resolution of one minute</li>
<li>It combines metrics coming from all the Functions belonging to the same Function App into a single value</li>
</ul>

<p>There&rsquo;s currently no way to get the cost of <em>GB-seconds</em> consumption per single execution. However, you can get the duration of each execution from a tool called <strong>Application Insights</strong>. Since the metrics are reported individually per each Function and each execution, they should help you estimate the cost structure for a given Function App.</p>

<p>The best tool to explore this data is <em>Application Insights Logs</em>. Select the Application Insights account associated with your Function App and click <em>Logs (Analytics)</em> in the toolbar and put the following query into the editor:</p>

<pre><code>customMetrics
| where name contains &quot;AvgDurationMs&quot;
| limit 100
</code></pre>

<p>The query retrieves a hundred sample metric values with the <em>name</em> column reflecting the Azure Function name, <em>Target</em> in this case, and <em>value</em> showing the execution duration in milliseconds:</p>

<p><img src="duration-logs.png" alt="Duration in Application Insights Logs" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Duration in Application Insights Logs</h4></figcaption>

<p>The same metric can be used to plot the duration distribution in time; here is a sample query:</p>

<pre><code>customMetrics
| where name contains &quot;AvgDurationMs&quot;
| summarize sum(value) by name, bin(timestamp, 1m)
| render timechart
</code></pre>

<p><img src="duration-chart.png" alt="Duration over Time in Application Insights Logs" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Duration over Time in Application Insights Logs</h4></figcaption>

<p>You can see that the Function plotted in blue has spent much more execution time than the green one.</p>

<h2 id="cost-beyond-functions">Cost Beyond Functions</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that we only discussed the direct cost of Azure Functions executions. There are several other potential costs associated with running an Azure Function App:</p>

<ul>
<li>Application Insights. Depending on the event volume and sampling settings, the cost of this monitoring service can become quite substantial and exceed the cost of Azure Functions themselves. Be careful and test your configuration before and soon after going to production.</li>
<li>Network traffic. If your Functions serve the traffic to the outside world, the networking fees apply. They are usually relatively low, but the cost may build up for high-volume Functions serving bulk data.</li>
<li>Storage. Azure Functions use a Storage Account for internal state and coordination. In my experience, these costs are negligible.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this article gives you enough perspective to start looking into the real cost of your serverless applications. May your Functions stay performant and the bill low!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>From config files to Key Vault and role-based access, learn how infrastructure as code helps manage application secrets in Azure.</blockquote>

<p>Every non-trivial application relies on configuration values that may depend on the current execution environment. Some of these values contain sensitive information that shouldn&rsquo;t be shared publicly. In general, the fewer parties that have access to those secret values, the safer the application will be&mdash;in fact, in an ideal world, no one would be granted direct access to those secrets.</p>

<p>Examples of secret configuration values include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A connection string to a message bus or a database</li>
<li>A SAS Token to an Azure Storage account</li>
<li>An access key for a third-party service</li>
</ul>

<p>There&rsquo;s no one universal way to manage secrets, as a lot depends on the context in which they are used. In this article, I go through seven ways to use secret values in a .NET Core application running in Azure. I start with naively hard-coded strings and build up from there to more secure options.</p>

<p>While the concepts are universally applicable, my code samples focus on a .NET application running in <strong>Azure App Service</strong> and configured with Pulumi.</p>

<h2 id="1-hard-coded-secrets">1. Hard-coded Secrets</h2>

<p>Whenever you want to try a new API requiring a secret access token, it&rsquo;s natural to copy-paste that secret into your code and run it&mdash;simply to make sure that the setup works.</p>

<p>For example, you are testing integration with a payment service:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cs" data-lang="cs"><span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> apiKey = <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;payment-service-key&#34;</span>;
<span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> paymentService = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> PaymentService(apiKey);
</code></pre></div>
<p>or you want to start sending messages to an <strong>Azure Storage Queue</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cs" data-lang="cs"><span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> connectionString = <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=account-name;AccountKey=account-key&#34;</span>;
<span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(connectionString);
<span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient();
</code></pre></div>
<p>Both snippets are fine for a Hello-World application with a lifespan of two hours. However, I would strongly discourage doing so in any code that can potentially be checked into a source control system, even for a 10-minute experiment. Don&rsquo;t copy-paste secrets into files which are part of a git repository. One accidental <code>git commit &amp; git push</code>&mdash;and the secrets are compromised.</p>

<p>Avoid the &ldquo;Secrets as Code&rdquo; practice: there are bots scanning your GitHub repository for those.</p>

<h2 id="2-configuration-files">2. Configuration Files</h2>

<p>Traditionally, putting secrets in a configuration file is considered more secure. For classic .NET applications, this would be an <code>app.config</code> or a <code>web.config</code> file. The idea is that the values on a developer machine are different from the values in the production environment. Non-sensitive development settings are kept on disk and maybe in source control, while the real secrets are only injected by a deployment script or a CI/CD system, so they are not exposed publicly.</p>

<p>In the .NET Core world, a configuration is usually stored in an <code>appsettings.json</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
   &#34;MyConfig&#34;: {
       &#34;PaymentApiKey&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;payment-service-key&#34;</span>,
       &#34;StorageConnectionString&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=account-name;AccountKey=account-key&#34;</span>
  }
}</code></pre></div>
<p>which is then mapped to a plain C# object in code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cs" data-lang="cs"><span style="color:#00f">public</span> <span style="color:#00f">class</span> <span style="color:#2b91af">MyConfig</span>
{
   <span style="color:#00f">public</span> <span style="color:#2b91af">string</span> PaymentApiKey { <span style="color:#00f">get</span>; <span style="color:#00f">set</span>; }
   <span style="color:#00f">public</span> <span style="color:#2b91af">string</span> StorageConnectionString { <span style="color:#00f">get</span>; <span style="color:#00f">set</span>; }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>With some configuration not shown here, the properties are filled at startup time and can be used in the code as a plain object:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cs" data-lang="cs"><span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> apiKey = config.PaymentApiKey;
<span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> paymentService = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> PaymentService(apiKey);
<span style="color:#008000">// ...
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>
<span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> connectionString = config.StorageConnectionString;
<span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(connectionString);
<span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient();
</code></pre></div>
<p>In my experience, such setup still poses substantial risks. <code>appsettings.production.json</code> may still be accidentally checked into the source control. Developers tend to use real cloud resources for their local and test environments, which do contain sensitive information that can be exploited when leaked.</p>

<p>On top of that, it doesn&rsquo;t feel right to mix configuration&mdash;how many threads to run, or how big the message batches should be&mdash;with secret connection strings and API keys in the same file. These are separate kinds of configuration, and they warrant different workflows.</p>

<h2 id="3-environment-variables-and-application-settings">3. Environment Variables and Application Settings</h2>

<p>One alternative approach is to read the secret values from environment variables. .NET Core configuration system can parse environment variables instead of, or in addition to the settings files. Likewise, one could read such values with a one-liner in C#:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cs" data-lang="cs"><span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;PAYMENT_API_KEY&#34;</span>);
<span style="color:#008000">// ...
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>
<span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING&#34;</span>);
<span style="color:#008000">// ...
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Your CI/CD system should inject those values as part of the deployment pipeline.</p>

<p>The App Service gives you the ability to set environment variables via <strong>Application Settings</strong>. Here is a snippet of a Pulumi program that passes both secret values to <code>appSettings</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> cfg = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> pulumi.Config();
<span style="color:#00f">const</span> paymentApiKey = cfg.requireSecret(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;paymentApiKey&#34;</span>);

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> storageAccount = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.storage.Account(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;storage&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   accountReplicationType: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;LRS&#34;</span>,
   accountTier: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Standard&#34;</span>,
});

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> app = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.AppService(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;app&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   appServicePlanId: <span style="color:#2b91af">appServicePlan.id</span>,
   appSettings: {
       <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;PAYMENT_API_KEY&#34;</span>: paymentApiKey,
       <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING&#34;</span>: storageAccount.primaryConnectionString,
   },
});</code></pre></div>
<p>The Storage connection string is produced by the Pulumi program directly, so it doesn&rsquo;t have to be placed anywhere outside the program itself.</p>

<p>The payment service key is provided by a third party, so its encrypted value is stored in Pulumi configuration. Read <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/blog/managing-secrets-with-pulumi/">Managing Secrets with Pulumi</a> to learn about security options available for secrets in Pulumi config.</p>

<h2 id="4-azure-key-vault">4. Azure Key Vault</h2>

<p>In the previous example, both secrets end up in Application Settings. Every person with sufficient permissions may go to the App Service and see them in clear text. While this can be restricted, it&rsquo;s a good idea to grant full read access to the application developers and operators of the App Service to give them the full picture when troubleshooting issues.</p>

<p>In some cases, compliance to a certain standard may <em>require</em> the use of a certified key management service offering enhanced security for sensitive secrets.</p>

<p>Azure has a dedicated service for storing secrets, <strong>Azure Key Vault</strong>. You can create and populate a Key Vault with all the secrets from the same Pulumi program:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> vault = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.keyvault.KeyVault(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;vault&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   sku: {
       name: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;standard&#34;</span>,
   },
   tenantId: <span style="color:#2b91af">tenantId</span>,
   accessPolicies: [{
       tenantId,
       <span style="color:#008000">// The current principal has to be granted permissions to Key Vault so that it can actually add and then remove
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>       <span style="color:#008000">// secrets to/from the Key Vault. Otherwise, &#39;pulumi up&#39; and &#39;pulumi destroy&#39; operations will fail.
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>       objectId: <span style="color:#2b91af">currentPrincipal</span>,
       secretPermissions: [<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;delete&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;get&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;list&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;set&#34;</span>],
   }],
});

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> secret = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.keyvault.Secret(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;paymentApiKey&#34;</span>, {
   keyVaultId: <span style="color:#2b91af">vault.id</span>,
   value: <span style="color:#2b91af">paymentApiKey</span>,
});</code></pre></div>
<p>Additionally, one or many <strong>Service Principals</strong> (SP) should be configured to access the Key Vault. One SP which has been granted secret management access deploys the infrastructure by running the Pulumi program. That&rsquo;s why the snippet above assigns an access policy to <code>currentPrincipal</code>.</p>

<p>Another SP is used by the application itself to read the secret values. The Client ID and Client Secret parameters are placed in the application configuration. Finally, .NET Core configuration gets hooked to the Key Vault at startup:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cs" data-lang="cs">builder.AddAzureKeyVault(
   <span style="color:#a31515">$&#34;https://{config[&#34;</span>azureKeyVault:vault<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;]}.vault.azure.net/&#34;</span>,
   config[&#34;azureKeyVault:clientId&#34;],
   config[&#34;azureKeyVault:clientSecret&#34;]
);
</code></pre></div>
<p>This solution is not entirely satisfying though, since we&rsquo;ve traded storing the secrets for storing SP credentials. Is that a big enough win?  Luckily, it&rsquo;s easy to get rid of those credentials with Managed Service Identity.</p>

<h2 id="5-accessing-key-vault-with-managed-service-identity">5. Accessing Key Vault with Managed Service Identity</h2>

<p>With <strong>Managed Service Identity</strong> (MSI), Azure takes care of creating a Service Principal, passing the credentials, rotating secrets, and so on. Enabling MSI on App Service is just an extra option:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> app = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.AppService(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;app&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   appServicePlanId: <span style="color:#2b91af">appServicePlan.id</span>,
   <span style="color:#008000">// A system-assigned managed service identity
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>   identity: {
       type: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;SystemAssigned&#34;</span>,
   },
});</code></pre></div>
<p>On top of that, the managed principal must be granted access to the Key Vault:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> principalId = app.identity.apply(id =&gt; id.principalId);

<span style="color:#008000">// Grant App Service access to KV secrets
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span><span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.keyvault.AccessPolicy(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;app-policy&#34;</span>, {
   keyVaultId: <span style="color:#2b91af">vault.id</span>,
   tenantId: <span style="color:#2b91af">tenantId</span>,
   objectId: <span style="color:#2b91af">principalId</span>,
   secretPermissions: [<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;get&#34;</span>],
});</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, the configuration block in the .NET Core app doesn&rsquo;t need to retrieve any secrets. <code>AzureServiceTokenProvider</code> helps with the authentication process:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cs" data-lang="cs"><span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> azureServiceTokenProvider = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> AzureServiceTokenProvider();
<span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> keyVaultClient = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> KeyVaultClient(
   <span style="color:#00f">new</span> KeyVaultClient.AuthenticationCallback(
       azureServiceTokenProvider.KeyVaultTokenCallback));
builder.AddAzureKeyVault(
   keyVaultEndpoint, keyVaultClient, <span style="color:#00f">new</span> DefaultKeyVaultSecretManager());
</code></pre></div>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite a bit of a boilerplate, but there is a way to get rid of it.</p>

<h2 id="6-accessing-key-vault-from-application-settings">6. Accessing Key Vault from Application Settings</h2>

<p>App Service has a neat feature of integrating its Application Settings with Key Vault. It allows us to combine #3 and #5&rsquo;s approaches and get the best of both:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#008000">// Produce a URI of the KV secret defined above

   }
});</code></pre></div>
<p>With that, the API key is loaded into the App Service environment variable without its value being publicly exposed anywhere!</p>

<h2 id="7-role-based-access-control">7. Role-based Access Control</h2>

<p>What is the most secure way to deal with secrets? <em>Have no secrets</em>. The Storage Account connection string is a great example when it&rsquo;s possible to avoid storing and reading the sensitive value altogether.</p>

<p><strong>Role-based access control</strong> (RBAC) of <strong>Azure Active Directory</strong> (AAD) is a great tool to manage permissions in a declarative way. Let&rsquo;s assume our application only needs to send messages to one Storage Queue. Instead of storing a full connection string with an access token, the connection string should point to the account, and the identity behind the App Service should be granted write permissions to the required Storage Queue:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> permission = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.role.Assignment(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;send&#34;</span>, {

   roleDefinitionName: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Storage Queue Data Message Sender&#34;</span>,
});</code></pre></div>
<p>We can put the queue URL into Application Settings because there&rsquo;s nothing secret in it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> queueUri = pulumi.interpolate<span style="color:#a31515">`</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>storageAccount.primaryQueueEndpoint<span style="color:#a31515">}${</span>queue.name<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span>;

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> app = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.AppService(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;app&#34;</span>, {

   appSettings: {
       <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;STORAGE_QUEUE_URL&#34;</span>: queueUri,
   },</code></pre></div>
<p>It takes a bit of C# boilerplate to send a message with role-based authorization:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cs" data-lang="cs"><span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> provider = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> AzureServiceTokenProvider();
<span style="color:#2b91af">string</span> accessToken = <span style="color:#00f">await</span> provider.GetAccessTokenAsync(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;https://storage.azure.com/&#34;</span>);
<span style="color:#2b91af">var</span> tokenCredential = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> TokenCredential(accessToken);

</code></pre></div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope another quality-of-life improvement is on the way.</p>

<h2 id="role-of-infrastructure-as-code">Role of Infrastructure as Code</h2>

<p>While security practices may vary depending on application requirements, Pulumi plays an essential role in the appropriate setup of service configuration and environment:</p>

<ul>
<li>It links an output of one resource to another one&rsquo;s input, avoiding the need to store the values.</li>
<li>It provides a built-in mechanism to manage external secrets.</li>
<li>It is a great way to take advantage of Azure features like MSI and RBAC in a cohesive way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Infrastructure as Code helps make your applications secure and reliable. Refer to <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-msi-keyvault-rbac">this full example</a> of using Key Vault, MSI, RBAC with App Service and Pulumi.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Verifying your Function App as a valid target for the cloud load testing.</blockquote>

<p>When Azure Functions team presented the new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-premium-plan">Premium plan</a>, they made a series of demos which compared the response time of a Function App running on the Consumption plan vs. an App running on the Premium plan. Both apps would receive a rapid growth of incoming requests, and then the percentiles of response latencies were compared.</p>

<p>The demos used a tool called <a href="https://loader.io/">Loader</a>, also referred to as &ldquo;Loader.io&rdquo;. The tool is visual and easy-to-use, but there is one step which might be just a little bit tricky to go through: verification. To avoid DDoS-ing somebody else&rsquo;s site, Loader requires users to verify each Target host by placing a key on a given URL of that domain.</p>

<p>If you want to follow along, it&rsquo;s time to create an account at <a href="https://loader.io/">loader.io</a>&mdash;they have a free plan. After signing in, go to <a href="https://loader.io/targets/new">New target host</a> and enter the URL of your Function App:</p>

<p><img src="new-target-host.png" alt="Azure Function App as a new target host" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Azure Function App as a new target host</h4></figcaption>

<p>Click &ldquo;Next: Verify&rdquo; button, and you are given a token to put inside your Function App to prove the ownership of it:</p>

<p><img src="target-verification.png" alt="Target Verification of Azure Function App" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Target Verification of Azure Function App</h4></figcaption>

<p>I know two ways to achieve verification.</p>

<h2 id="option-1-function-proxies">Option 1: Function Proxies</h2>

<p>With <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-proxies">Azure Functions Proxies</a>, you can specify endpoints in your Function App which aren&rsquo;t handled by Functions directly but redirect the requests to other endpoints or respond with a hard-coded response.</p>

<p>The later is exactly what we need. Create a <code>proxies.json</code> file in the root of your Function App, next to the <code>host.json</code> file, and put the following content in there:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
    &#34;$schema&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;http://json.schemastore.org/proxies&#34;</span>,
    &#34;proxies&#34;: {
        &#34;loaderio-verifier&#34;: {
            &#34;matchCondition&#34;: {
                &#34;methods&#34;: [ <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;GET&#34;</span> ],
                &#34;route&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;/loaderio-your-token-goes-here&#34;</span>
            },
            &#34;responseOverrides&#34;: {
                &#34;response.body&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;loaderio-your-token-goes-here&#34;</span>,
                &#34;response.headers.Content-Type&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;text/plain&#34;</span>
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to replace <code>loaderio-your-token-goes-here</code> value with the token that you received at the previous step. Now, the hard-coded response is returned at the endpoint which Loader uses for verification.</p>

<p>If your Function App is a .NET project, include <code>proxies.json</code> to the <code>csproj</code>/<code>fsproj</code> file, so that it becomes a part of the deployment artifact:</p>

      &lt;None Update=&quot;proxies.json&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/None&gt;
   &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After re-publishing the Function App, you should be able to see a new proxy in the portal:</p>

<p><img src="loader-verifier-proxy.png" alt="Loader Verifier Proxy in the Azure Portal" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Loader Verifier Proxy in the Azure Portal</h4></figcaption>

<p>You are all set to go! Click the &ldquo;Verify&rdquo; button to see</p>

<p><img src="target-verification-congrats.png" alt="Target Verification Completed of Azure Function App" /></p>

<h2 id="option-2-another-function">Option 2: Another Function</h2>

<p>Instead of dealing with Proxies, you could create another Azure Function in the same App and let it return the token.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example of defining such a Function with TypeScript and Pulumi.</p>

<p>Say, I want to load-test the following target HTTP function (it just pauses for 500 ms):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> target = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.HttpFunction(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Target&#34;</span>, {
    callback: <span style="color:#2b91af">async</span> (context, req) =&gt; {
        await <span style="color:#00f">new</span> Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, 500));
        <span style="color:#00f">return</span> {
            status: <span style="color:#2b91af">200</span>,
            body: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Hello World!&#34;</span>,
        };
    },
});</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, I can add another HTTP function to handle the verification requests:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> verifier = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.HttpFunction(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Verifier&#34;</span>, {
    route: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;loaderio-your-token-goes-here&#34;</span>,
    callback: <span style="color:#2b91af">async</span> (context, req) =&gt; {
        <span style="color:#00f">return</span> {
            status: <span style="color:#2b91af">200</span>,
            body: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;loaderio-your-token-goes-here&#34;</span>,
        };
    },
});</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, I put both Functions into a Function App and deploy them together:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> app = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.MultiCallbackFunctionApp(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;loaderio&#34;</span>, {
    resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
    functions: [target, verifier],
    hostSettings: { extensions: { http: { routePrefix: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;&#34;</span> } } },
});

<span style="color:#00f">export</span> <span style="color:#00f">const</span> endpoint = app.endpoint;</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that I set <code>routePrefix</code> to an empty string to avoid <code>api</code> prefix in my URLs (I usually do it anyway). Now, as soon as Pulumi deploys my App, I can start testing it with Loader.</p>

<p>You can find a full example involving the <code>MultiCallbackFunctionApp</code> component <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure/blob/master/examples/http-multi/index.ts">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="running-the-load-tests">Running the Load Tests</h2>

<p>Regardless of which path you chose, you should now be good to start using Loader to run performance tests on your Azure Functions.</p>

<p>Here is a chart of a sample test that I ran to make sure the setup works:</p>

<p><img src="loader-results.png" alt="Loader.io Test Results" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Loader.io Test Results</h4></figcaption>

<p>Which test parameters to use and what kind of results you might get depends a lot on your application. That&rsquo;s a good topic for another post someday.</p>

<p>For now, happy testing!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Azure CLI is a powerful tool to manage your cloud resources. Where does it store the sensitive information and why might you want to care?</blockquote>

<p>Azure has several tools available to create and manage cloud resources. The Azure command-line interface (CLI) is probably the second most-used tool after the web portal. The CLI runs on any platform and covers a wide variety of actions. Here is a command to create a new Virtual Machine:</p>

<pre><code>az vm create --resource-group Sample --name VM1 --image UbuntuLTS --generate-ssh-keys
</code></pre>

<p>If you use Azure for your day-to-day job or hobby projects, it&rsquo;s quite likely that you already have the Azure CLI installed on your computer.</p>

<h2 id="azure-login">Azure login</h2>

<p>The very first command that you run after installing the CLI on your development machine is going to be</p>

<pre><code>az login
</code></pre>

<p>There are several sign-in flows, but most typically the CLI opens the default browser asking you to log in there. The login operation has a unique session identifier. Once you sign in with this session ID, the CLI receives a notification on its back channel. The notification contains a JWT access token.</p>

<p>From this point on, the access token is used by most other CLI commands to access Azure Management REST API. API uses OAuth protocol where the access token is passed in the <code>Authorization</code> HTTP header.</p>

<h2 id="storing-tokens-on-the-local-disk">Storing tokens on the local disk</h2>

<p>However, there is one problem. The CLI is a short-lived program: it runs for the duration of a single command execution and then quits. The process dies, so there&rsquo;s no way to keep access tokens in memory between the executions. To avoid continually asking for user credentials, the CLI keeps its state on disk. If you go to the <code>~/.azure/</code> directory (<code>%HOMEPATH%/.azure/</code> in Windows command-line) you can find several of such state files:</p>

<pre><code>~/.azure&gt; ls

accessTokens.json
az.json
az.sess
azureProfile.json
clouds.configtelemetry.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Two of these files contain some relevant information. <code>azureProfile.json</code> lists the properties of your Azure subscriptions and users (no passwords or tokens).</p>

<p><code>accessTokens.json</code> is more interesting. As the name suggests, it contains all the tokens from the Azure CLI, right there in plain text. Here is the shape of JSON entries in there:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
   &#34;tokenType&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Bearer&#34;</span>,
   &#34;expiresIn&#34;: 3599,
   &#34;expiresOn&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;2019-05-05 00:22:01.577315&#34;</span>,
   &#34;resource&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;https://management.core.windows.net/&#34;</span>,
   &#34;accessToken&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;...&#34;</span>,
   &#34;refreshToken&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;...&#34;</span>,
   &#34;identityProvider&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;live.com&#34;</span>,
   &#34;userId&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;...&#34;</span>,
   &#34;isMRRT&#34;: <span style="color:#00f">true</span>,
   &#34;_clientId&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;...&#34;</span>,
   &#34;_authority&#34;: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;https://login.microsoftonline.com/common&#34;</span>
}</code></pre></div>
<p>There are multiple entries like this for different combinations of <code>resource</code>, <code>_authority</code>, and others. Obviously, I removed all the sensitive values from this snippet, but you could see yours in plain text. Go ahead and copy-paste a value of <code>accessToken</code> property to &ldquo;Encoded&rdquo; the text box on <a href="https://jwt.io">https://jwt.io</a> page. The site decodes the token and shows you the properties:</p>

<p><img src="azure-jwt-decoded.png" alt="Azure access token decoded with JWT.io" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Azure access token decoded with JWT.io</h4></figcaption>

<p>The access token has a limited lifespan&mdash;mine are all 60 minutes. To avoid requiring to login after access expiration, there is another powerful token&mdash;a refresh token. Whenever an access token expires, CLI goes to the authentication service, presents the refresh token, and asks for a new access token. The lifetime of a refresh token is longer, and it&rsquo;s managed on the service side. There are some configurable policies to expire it: for instance, Azure might invalidate a token if it was inactive for more than X days. It can also be revoked manually at any time.</p>

<p>The refresh tokens are stored inside the same <code>accessTokens.json</code> file, right next to the access token (see the snippet above). It&rsquo;s not a JWT token: it is an opaque blob sent from Azure AD whose contents are not known to any client components. You cannot see whatâ€™s inside a refresh token but Azure can.</p>

<h2 id="token-reuse-by-other-tools">Token reuse by other tools</h2>

<p>We learned that access tokens are not specific to the Azure CLI and aren&rsquo;t used exclusively by it. Let&rsquo;s run a short experiment:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Run <code>az login</code> or any other Azure CLI command to make sure there&rsquo;s a current access token.</p></li>

<li><p>Open <code>azureProfile.json</code> and copy-paste the subscription <code>id</code> field into the following URL: <code>https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups?api-version=2019-05-10</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Open the <code>accessTokens.json</code> file, find the latest entry, and copy the <code>accessToken</code> field.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, build the following cURL command out of these two values:</p>

<pre><code>curl --header &quot;Authorization: Bearer {access-token}&quot; \
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups?api-version=2019-05-10
</code></pre>

<p>Run the command, and you get the list of resource groups in your subscription!</p>

<p>By the way, you can also find both properties with the Azure CLI commands <code>az account list</code> and <code>az account get-access-token</code>. It doesn&rsquo;t feel as hacky as copy-pasting from JSON files, but it is more convenient :)</p>

<p>Multiple third-party tools use the fact that the Azure CLI can log in to Azure and then provide access tokens. Both Terraform and Pulumi have a default method of authenticating into Azure with the Azure CLI. They probably delegate to the CLI instead of accessing the <code>accessTokens.json</code> file directly, but that&rsquo;s mostly convenience and not the hard requirement. Effectively, they are able to reuse the tokens created by the Azure CLI for their own purpose.</p>

<h2 id="security-risks-of-token-exposure">Security risks of token exposure</h2>

<p>This is all handy and good. However, there is a dark side of convenience. The existence of a file with clear-text Azure access tokens means that you should be careful not to expose that file to anyone. Don&rsquo;t share your <code>~/.azure/</code> folder with anybody, don&rsquo;t put it on GitHub, don&rsquo;t upload it to random file-sharing applications.</p>

<p>Access tokens file could potentially become an attack vector. Say, you install a new shiny CLI tool from NPM (many developers have dozens of them). You run it from your user account, the tool does its job but also silently uploads <code>accessTokens.json</code> file to somebody&rsquo;s FTP. A month later, you get surprised while looking at your Azure bill.</p>

<p>I checked this scenario by uploading my <code>~/.azure</code> folder to a brand-new VM. A fresh installation of the Azure CLI happily welcomes me without the need for <code>az login</code>:</p>

<p><img src="cli-on-vm.png" alt="Azure CLI open on a new VM with copied credentials" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Azure CLI open on a new VM with copied credentials</h4></figcaption>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Know your tools, reuse the power of Azure CLI for those Azure Management REST API crunching sessions, and keep your machine safe.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Building a serverless application on Azure with both the data store and the HTTP endpoint located close to end users for fast response time.</blockquote>

<p>Pulumi is excellent at connecting multiple cloud components into a cohesive application. In my <a href="https://blog.pulumi.com/serverless-as-simple-callbacks-with-pulumi-and-azure-functions">previous post</a>, I introduced the way to mix JavaScript or TypeScript serverless functions directly into the cloud infrastructure programs.</p>

<p>Today, I will build a serverless application with both the data store and the HTTP endpoint located close to end users to ensure prompt response time. The entire application runs on top of managed Azure services and is defined as a single Pulumi program in TypeScript.</p>

<h2 id="baseline">Baseline</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to build a URL shortener: a simple HTTP endpoint which accepts a shortcode in the URL and then redirects a user to the full URL associated with the given short code.</p>

<p>I start simple and make a non-distributed version of the application first. It consists of two main components: a Cosmos DB container to store URL mappings and two Azure Functions to handle HTTP requests:</p>

<p><img src="pulumi-azure-url-shortener-basic.png" alt="The URL Shortener app deployed to a single location" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>The URL Shortener app deployed to a single location</h4></figcaption>

<p>Let&rsquo;s define this infrastructure in a Pulumi program.</p>

<h3 id="cosmos-db-collection">Cosmos DB Collection</h3>

<p>Arguably, Cosmos DB is overkill in such a simple scenario: we just need a key-value store, so Table Storage would suffice. However, Cosmos DB comes handy at the multi-region setup later on.</p>

<p>Next to a standard resource group definition, I create a Cosmos DB account with location set to a single region and <code>Session</code> consistency level:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">import</span> * <span style="color:#00f">as</span> pulumi from <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;@pulumi/pulumi&#34;</span>;
<span style="color:#00f">import</span> * <span style="color:#00f">as</span> azure from <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;@pulumi/azure&#34;</span>;
<span style="color:#00f">import</span> * <span style="color:#00f">as</span> cosmos from <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;@azure/cosmos&#34;</span>;

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> location = <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;westus&#34;</span>; <span style="color:#008000">// To be changed to multiple configurable locations
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>
<span style="color:#00f">let</span> resourceGroup = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.core.ResourceGroup(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;UrlShorterner&#34;</span>, {
   location,
});

<span style="color:#00f">let</span> cosmosdb = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.cosmosdb.Account(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;UrlStore&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   location,
   geoLocations: [{ location, failoverPriority: <span style="color:#2b91af">0</span> }],
   offerType: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Standard&#34;</span>,
   consistencyPolicy: {
       consistencyLevel: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Session&#34;</span>,
       maxIntervalInSeconds: <span style="color:#2b91af">5</span>,
       maxStalenessPrefix: <span style="color:#2b91af">100</span>,
   },
});</code></pre></div>
<p>Cosmos DB has a hierarchical structure of Accounts, Databases, and Containers. Unfortunately, Cosmos DB containers canâ€™t be defined as Pulumi resources yet. As a workaround, I defined a helper function <code>getContainer</code> to create a database and a container using Cosmos SDK, see <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/blob/master/azure-ts-serverless-url-shortener-global/cosmosclient.ts">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="function-app">Function App</h3>

<p>Serverless Azure Functions are going to handle the HTTP layer in my application. I use the technique of <a href="https://blog.pulumi.com/serverless-as-simple-callbacks-with-pulumi-and-azure-functions">serverless functions as callbacks</a> to define Azure Functions inline inside my Pulumi program:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> fn = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.HttpEventSubscription(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;GetUrl&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroup,
   location,
   route: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;{key}&#34;</span>,
   callback: <span style="color:#2b91af">async</span> (_, request: <span style="color:#2b91af">azure.appservice.HttpRequest</span>) =&gt; {
       <span style="color:#00f">const</span> endpoint = cosmosdb.endpoint.get();
       <span style="color:#00f">const</span> masterKey = cosmosdb.primaryMasterKey.get();

       <span style="color:#00f">const</span> container = await getContainer(endpoint, masterKey);

       <span style="color:#00f">const</span> key = request.params[<span style="color:#a31515">&#39;key&#39;</span>];
       <span style="color:#00f">try</span> {
           <span style="color:#00f">const</span> response = await container.item(key.toString()).read();
           <span style="color:#00f">return</span> {
               status: <span style="color:#2b91af">301</span>,
               headers: { <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;location&#34;</span>: response.body.url },
               body: <span style="color:#a31515">&#39;&#39;</span>,
           };
       } <span style="color:#00f">catch</span> (e) {
           <span style="color:#00f">return</span> { status: <span style="color:#2b91af">404</span>, body: <span style="color:#a31515">&#39;Short URL not found&#39;</span> }
       }
   }
});

<span style="color:#00f">export</span> <span style="color:#00f">const</span> url = fn.url;</code></pre></div>
<p>I supply the template <code>{key}</code> as <code>route</code> parameter so that the function accepts wildcard URLs and extract the wildcard value as a <code>key</code> parameter available inside the <code>request</code> object. Then, I use the received key to look up the full URL. The URL is returned to the client as a header of the <code>301</code> Redirect response. <code>404</code> Not Found is returned in case the requested document does not exist&mdash;the naughty Cosmos SDK throws an error in this scenario.</p>

<p>Note how the Cosmos DB parameters <code>endpoint</code> and <code>primaryMasterKey</code> are used directly inside the function. There is no need to manage the keys manually or explicitly put them into application settings: the generated keys are injected into the code at the time of deployment. In practice, a better idea is to store the key in a KeyVault and read it via application settings, but I&rsquo;ll leave this for a separate article.</p>

<p>A function to add a URL to the database looks quite similar to the above:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> fn = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.HttpEventSubscription(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;AddUrl&#34;</span>, {

   }
});
<span style="color:#00f">export</span> <span style="color:#00f">const</span> addEndpoint = fn.url;</code></pre></div>
<p>The key differences are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using <code>POST</code> as the accepted HTTP method</li>
<li>Creating a new item in Cosmos DB</li>
<li>Using <code>request.body</code> as the payload to save</li>
</ul>

<p>I might need to add some validation in a real application&mdash;skipped for now.</p>

<h3 id="trying-it-out">Trying It Out</h3>

<p>Now, when a user navigates to an address like <code>https://geturl-xyz.azurewebsites.net/api/URLKEY</code>, they get redirected to the full URL associated with the key. The URL is not quite short yet, but we could make it so with a custom domain configuration.</p>

<p>Presumably, we expect our URL shortener to be popular around the world. Therefore, one key aspect is to make sure that the service responds fast and enables a smooth user experience. Let&rsquo;s measure the response time of our first version from different spots around the world:</p>

<table class="table table-striped">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Location</th>
<th>Response time</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>San Francisco</td>
<td>133 ms</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>New York</td>
<td>272 ms</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>London</td>
<td>383 ms</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Frankfurt</td>
<td>420 ms</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Tel-Aviv</td>
<td>470 ms</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Hong-Kong</td>
<td>437 ms</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Brisbane</td>
<td>449 ms</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The further we get from the West US region, the slower the responses become.</p>

<p>How can we do better?</p>

<h2 id="bring-compute-and-data-closer-to-users">Bring Compute and Data Closer to Users</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to beat the speed of light, so if we want to respond fast, we need to bring both code and data close to any target user.</p>

<p>Luckily, the most involved aspect of that&mdash;the data distribution&mdash;can be handled by Cosmos DB multi-region accounts. We need to take care of deploying the code in multiple locations and routing the traffic to the nearest one. Here is the plan:</p>

<p><img src="pulumi-azure-url-shortener-distributed.png" alt="The multi-region URL Shortener app" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>The multi-region URL Shortener app</h4></figcaption>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care too much about the latency of Add URL function, so I left it out of the picture.</p>

<h3 id="configuring-the-locations">Configuring the locations</h3>

<p>The above picture shows three Azure regions, but since I&rsquo;m using a general-purpose programming language, I can handle any number of locations in the same way. Actually, I put the list of target regions in Pulumi config file and read it at execution time:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> config = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> pulumi.Config();
<span style="color:#00f">const</span> locations = config.require(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;locations&#34;</span>).split(<span style="color:#a31515">&#39;,&#39;</span>);
<span style="color:#00f">const</span> primaryLocation = locations[0];</code></pre></div>
<p>The order of regions defines the priority.</p>

<h3 id="multi-region-cosmos-db-account">Multi-region Cosmos DB Account</h3>

<p>Since <code>locations</code> is a simple array, I can <code>map</code> this array to produce the array of <code>geoLocations</code> to be set for my Cosmos DB:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">let</span> cosmosdb = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.cosmosdb.Account(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;url-cosmos&#34;</span>, {
   location: <span style="color:#2b91af">primaryLocation</span>,
   geoLocations: <span style="color:#2b91af">locations.map</span>((location, failoverPriority) =&gt; ({
       location,
       failoverPriority
   })),
   <span style="color:#008000">/* ... other properties stay the same ... */</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Right here, the full power of a programming language at my fingertips!</p>

<h3 id="multi-region-serverless-app">Multi-region Serverless App</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables you to distribute traffic optimally to services across global Azure regions while providing high availability and responsiveness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like what I need for my global application! Let&rsquo;s define a Traffic Manager profile:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> profile = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.trafficmanager.Profile(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;UrlShortEndpoint&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   trafficRoutingMethod: <span style="color:#a31515">&#39;Performance&#39;</span>,
   dnsConfigs: [{
       relativeName: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;shorturls&#34;</span>,
       ttl: <span style="color:#2b91af">60</span>,
   }],
   monitorConfigs: [{
       protocol: <span style="color:#a31515">&#39;HTTP&#39;</span>,
       port: <span style="color:#2b91af">80</span>,
       path: <span style="color:#a31515">&#39;/api/ping&#39;</span>,
   }]
});</code></pre></div>
<p>I set the routing method to Performance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Select Performance when you have endpoints in different geographic locations and you want end users to use the &ldquo;closest&rdquo; endpoint in terms of the lowest network latency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I need to create a Function App in each of the target regions. That&rsquo;s easy to achieve with a <code>for..of</code> loop:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">for</span> (<span style="color:#00f">const</span> location of locations) {
   <span style="color:#00f">const</span> fn = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.HttpEventSubscription(<span style="color:#a31515">`GetUrl-</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>location<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span>, {
       resourceGroup,
       location,
       route: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;{key}&#34;</span>,
       callback: <span style="color:#008000">/* ... the function stays the same ... */</span>
   });
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, I set up an Endpoint for each Function App to bind them to the Traffic Manager. I do so in the same loop as above:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">for</span> (<span style="color:#00f">const</span> location of locations) {
   <span style="color:#00f">const</span> fn = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.HttpEventSubscription(<span style="color:#a31515">`GetUrl-</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>location<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span>, {
       <span style="color:#008000">/* ... function definition as shown above ... */</span>
   });

   <span style="color:#00f">const</span> app = fn.functionApp;

   <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.trafficmanager.Endpoint(<span style="color:#a31515">`tme</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>location<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span>, {
       resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
       profileName: <span style="color:#2b91af">profile.name</span>,
       type: <span style="color:#a31515">&#39;azureEndpoints&#39;</span>,
       targetResourceId: <span style="color:#2b91af">app.id</span>,
       target: <span style="color:#2b91af">app.defaultHostname</span>,
       endpointLocation: <span style="color:#2b91af">app.location</span>,
   });
}</code></pre></div>
<p>I assign the properties of each Function App to the corresponding Endpoint with a simple object initializer expression.</p>

<p>Everything is in place. I can export the Traffic Manager endpoint:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">export</span> <span style="color:#00f">const</span> endpoint = pulumi.interpolate <span style="color:#a31515">`http://</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>profile.fqdn<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">/api/{key}`</span>;</code></pre></div>
<p>Time to re-run the latency tests.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>I deployed the distributed infrastructure to five Azure regions: West US, East US, West Europe, East Asia, and Australia East. The results are shown in the table below, next to the values from the initial run:</p>

<table class="table table-striped">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Location</th>
<th>Single region</th>
<th>Multiple regions</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>San Francisco</td>
<td>133 ms</td>
<td>140 ms</td>

<tr>
<td>New York</td>
<td>272 ms</td>
<td>152 ms</td>
</tr>

<tr>

<td>437 ms</td>
<td>149 ms</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Brisbane</td>
<td>449 ms</td>
<td>529 ms</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>We got a much smoother distribution of response time. There&rsquo;s no region close enough to Tel-Aviv, so its latency is still high-ish. I checked Brisbane, and the traffic was somehow directed to the East US region, so the latency hasn&rsquo;t improved at all. For today, I guess I&rsquo;ll stick to the hypothesis &ldquo;Australian internet is slow&rdquo; and advise to always test your target scenarios without trusting the providers blindly.</p>

<p>More importantly, I walked you through a scenario of developing an end-to-end application with Pulumi. I highlighted the power of leveraging familiar techniques coming from the TypeScript realm. You can find the full code in <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-serverless-url-shortener-global">Pulumi examples</a>.</p>

<p>Cloud brings superpowers to developer&rsquo;s hands. You just need to use those efficiently.</p>

<p>Static websites are back in the mainstream these days. Website generators like Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby, make it fairly easy to combine templates and markdown pages to produce static HTML files. Static assets are the simplest thing to serve and cache, so the whole setup ends up being fast and cost-efficient.</p>

<p>Many platforms offer services to host such static websites. This post explains the steps to create the infrastructure to do so on Microsoft Azure.</p>

<p>Setting up the infrastructure to serve a static website doesn&rsquo;t sound like it would be all that difficult, but when you consider HTTPS certificates, content distribution networks, and attaching it to a custom domain, integrating all the components can be quite daunting.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this is a task where Pulumi shines. Pulumi&rsquo;s code-centric approach not only makes configuring cloud resources easier to do and maintain, but it also eliminates the pain of integrating multiple services.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Our goal is to create a static website with a custom domain&mdash;I&rsquo;ll use an imaginary <code>demo.pulumi.com</code> for this article. In 2019, my website has to support HTTPS, so we need to create a custom TLS certificate too.</p>

<p>The final solution consists of several Azure services:</p>

<ul>
<li>Static files will be stored in a <strong>Blob Container</strong> inside a <strong>Storage Account</strong></li>
<li>The Storage Account will have <strong>Static Website feature</strong> enabled to have some basic URL rewrite rules</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll put an <strong>Azure CDN Endpoint</strong> in front of the container to support the custom domain over TLS</li>
<li>Azure CDN will self-manage the TLS certificate</li>
<li>Our custom DNS provider will have the rule to point to the CDN endpoint (that&rsquo;s a manual step)</li>
</ul>

<p>The diagram below outlines the interaction of these components:</p>

<p><img src="pulumi-azure-static-website.png" alt="Static website running on Azure and defined in Pulumi" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Static website running on Azure and defined in Pulumi</h4></figcaption>

<p>Let&rsquo;s break down how to configure each component using Pulumi.</p>

<h2 id="resource-group">Resource Group</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start a new Pulumi program, import the Pulumi packages, and define a new resource group:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">import</span> * <span style="color:#00f">as</span> pulumi from <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;@pulumi/pulumi&#34;</span>;
<span style="color:#00f">import</span> * <span style="color:#00f">as</span> azure from <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;@pulumi/azure&#34;</span>;

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> resourceGroup = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.core.ResourceGroup(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;demo-rg&#34;</span>, {
   location: <span style="color:#2b91af">azure.WestEurope</span>,
});</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="storage-account">Storage Account</h2>

<p>The Storage Account will contain our static website&rsquo;s assets:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> storageAccount = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.storage.Account(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;demopulumi&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   accountReplicationType: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;LRS&#34;</span>,
   accountTier: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Standard&#34;</span>,
   accountKind: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;StorageV2&#34;</span>,
});</code></pre></div>
<p>The only trick here is to make sure that the account kind is V2; otherwise, it won&rsquo;t support the static website feature.</p>

<h2 id="static-website-hosting-in-azure-storage">Static Website Hosting in Azure Storage</h2>

<p>Any storage container could be exposed as a web endpoint. However, that&rsquo;s not flexible enough. The URL would always include the container name and the exact file name, so the user would have to ask for <code>https://demo.pulumi.com/containername/index.html</code> instead of simply <code>https://demo.pulumi.com/</code>.</p>

<p>Enabling Static Website Hosting in Azure Storage improves this experience. A dedicated container <strong><code>$web</code></strong> gets automatically created, which also has special treatment for <code>index</code> and <code>404</code> documents.</p>

<p>The bad news is that Static Website Hosting is not a part of Azure Resource Manager API, and therefore, it&rsquo;s not available out-of-the-box in ARM templates, Terraform, or Pulumi. We can enable this feature with Azure CLI, so the solution is to create a dynamic Pulumi resource which enables Pulumi experience while delegating the work to the CLI. You can find the full source code for the dynamic resource in <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/blob/master/azure-ts-static-website/staticWebsite.ts">this example</a>, but the usage is quite trivial:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> staticWebsite = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> StorageStaticWebsite(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;demopulumi-static&#34;</span>,
   { accountName: <span style="color:#2b91af">storageAccount.name</span> },
   { parent: <span style="color:#2b91af">storageAccount</span> });

<span style="color:#008000">// Web endpoint to the website
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span><span style="color:#00f">export</span> <span style="color:#00f">const</span> staticEndpoint = staticWebsite.endpoint;</code></pre></div>
<p>The last line exports the static website endpoint. It will look something like <code>https://demopulumi01234abc.z6.web.core.windows.net/</code>&mdash;no custom domain yet, but already functional&mdash;once we deploy some static files in there.</p>

<h2 id="static-files">Static Files</h2>

<p>Now, it&rsquo;s time to upload the static files to the <code>$web</code> Blob Container.</p>

<p>For this demo, I&rsquo;ve created a folder <code>wwwroot</code> with two files in it: <code>index.html</code> and <code>404.html</code>. I can upload those files with the following Pulumi snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts">[<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;index.html&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;404.html&#34;</span>].map(name =&gt;
   <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.storage.Blob(name, {
       name,
       resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
       storageAccountName: <span style="color:#2b91af">storageAccount.name</span>,
       storageContainerName: <span style="color:#2b91af">staticWebsite.webContainerName</span>,
       type: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;block&#34;</span>,
       source: <span style="color:#a31515">`./wwwroot/</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>name<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span>,
       contentType: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;text/html&#34;</span>,
   })
);</code></pre></div>
<p>In practice, your static website might contain hundreds or thousands of files. At that point, you might want to split the file upload operation from Pulumi and do it as a separate step in your CI/CD pipeline.</p>

<h2 id="azure-cdn">Azure CDN</h2>

<p>To make the static website files available over our custom domain and HTTPS, we need to create an Azure CDN Endpoint and to point it to the storage account:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> cdn = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.cdn.Profile(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;demo-cdn&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   sku: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Standard_Microsoft&#34;</span>,
});

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> endpoint = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.cdn.Endpoint(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;demo-cdn-ep&#34;</span>, {
   name: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;demopulumi&#34;</span>,
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   profileName: <span style="color:#2b91af">cdn.name</span>,
   isHttpAllowed: <span style="color:#2b91af">true</span>,
   isHttpsAllowed: <span style="color:#2b91af">true</span>,
   originHostHeader: <span style="color:#2b91af">staticWebsite.hostName</span>,
   origins: [{
       name: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;blobstorage&#34;</span>,
       hostName: <span style="color:#2b91af">staticWebsite.hostName</span>,
   }],
});

<span style="color:#008000">// CDN endpoint to the website. Allow it some time after the deployment to get ready.
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span><span style="color:#00f">export</span> <span style="color:#00f">const</span> cdnEndpoint = pulumi.interpolate<span style="color:#a31515">`https://</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>endpoint.hostName<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">/`</span>;</code></pre></div>
<p>I specified an explicit name for the CDN Endpoint: <code>demopulumi</code>. This name has to be globally unique because it is a part of the endpoint URL <code>https://demopulumi.azureedge.net</code>. Please pick a custom name before running the program.</p>

<p>I pointed the CDN origin to the static website name with <code>staticWebsite.hostName</code>. As usual, it&rsquo;s easy to link resources in Pulumi code!</p>

<p>You might need to wait a few minutes before your content is visible as the CDN configuration is not immediately executed. I&rsquo;ve set <code>isHttpAllowed</code> to <code>true</code> because HTTP is available sooner than HTTPS; feel free to switch it off for your production configuration.</p>

<h2 id="configure-a-domain-dns-rule">Configure a Domain DNS Rule</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably registered your domain with some third-party provider. Follow the instructions of your provider to configure a CNAME rule for the website&rsquo;s DNS. For a custom domain <code>demo.pulumi.com</code>, the CNAME entry <code>demo</code> would be linked to the endpoint <code>demopulumi.azureedge.net</code>.</p>

<p>CNAME entries don&rsquo;t support &ldquo;naked&rdquo; domains like <code>pulumi.com</code>. If you want to set up a top-level domain to be served from the static Azure website, you&rsquo;d have to use an <a href="https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/alias-record/">Alias DNS record</a>, which isn&rsquo;t supported by some DNS providers. Please check with your provider for available options.</p>

<p>The following step assumes that a CNAME record is configured; otherwise, it would fail with a validation error.</p>

<h2 id="custom-domain-and-tls">Custom Domain and TLS</h2>

<p>The final step is to point our custom domain to the CDN endpoint and provision a TLS certificate to enable HTTPS support. Once again, these operations are not parts of the ARM API surface, so another <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/blob/master/azure-ts-dynamicresource/cdnCustomDomain.ts">dynamic resource</a> was created to support them.</p>

<p>The usage is quite straightforward, just make sure to use your own domain in the following snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> customDomain = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> CDNCustomDomainResource(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;cdn-custom-domain&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   <span style="color:#008000">// Ensure that there is a CNAME record for demo pointing.pulumi.com to demopulumi.azureedge.net.
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>   <span style="color:#008000">// You would do that in your domain registrar&#39;s portal.
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>   customDomainHostName: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;demo.pulumi.com&#34;</span>,
   profileName: <span style="color:#2b91af">cdn.name</span>,
   endpointName: <span style="color:#2b91af">endpoint.name</span>,
   <span style="color:#008000">// This will enable HTTPS through Azure&#39;s one-click automated certificate deployment.
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>   <span style="color:#008000">// The certificate is fully managed by Azure from provisioning to automatic renewal
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>   <span style="color:#008000">// at no additional cost to you.
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>   httpsEnabled: <span style="color:#2b91af">true</span>,
}, { parent: <span style="color:#2b91af">endpoint</span> });</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="bring-it-live">Bring It Live!</h2>

<p>And we are done! Run <code>pulumi up</code> and make sure that all resources get created successfully.</p>

<p>Start testing with <code>staticEndpoint</code>&mdash;it&rsquo;s the first one to become available. <code>cdnEndpoint</code> might return some <code>404</code>&rsquo;s at first, be patient. Then, try your custom domain with <code>HTTP</code>. Finally, the TLS certificate takes quite a while to be registered, so come back in an hour or so to test <code>HTTPS</code>.</p>

<p>While a &ldquo;static website&rdquo; may sound simple, we went through a rather complicated process to wire all the components together. Some Azure services and features are more straightforward to automate than others, but in the end, we combined all of them into one cohesive Pulumi program to host a static website, served over HTTPS and from a worldwide CDN. That&rsquo;s the power of a general-purpose programming language applied to the task of sophisticated infrastructure automation. Once the reusable components are in place, reliable and reproducible deployments become a reality.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>The simplest way to take a Node.js function and deploy it to Azure cloud as an HTTP endpoint using Pulumi.</blockquote>

<p>Serverless compute services, like Azure Functions, offer an amazing power to application developers to leverage: highly available, automatically scaled, low-ceremony, pay-per-value functions created in several lines of code.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s <strong>the simplest</strong> way to take a Node.js function and deploy it to Azure cloud as an HTTP endpoint? How about this little tutorial:</p>

<h4 id="1-create-a-new-pulumi-program">1. Create a new Pulumi program:</h4>

   };
 }
});

<span style="color:#00f">export</span> <span style="color:#00f">const</span> url = greeting.url;</code></pre></div>

<pre><code>$ curl https://greetingc21a23fe.azurewebsites.net/api/greeting?name=Pulumi
Hello Pulumi!
</code></pre>

<p>With 12 lines of code and two CLI commands, I&rsquo;ve created all Azure resources required to host a serverless function without an explicit configuration of Azure services. Okay, I had to define a location for my resource group, but that could also be accomplished via <code>pulumi config</code>.</p>

<p>Pulumi compiled my TypeScript function, serialized it to a JavaScript file, created the bindings in a <code>function.json</code> file, hosting configuration in a <code>host.json</code> file, uploaded all these assets to Blob Storage, and configured a Consumption Plan and a Function App to run my function. An automated and reproducible deployment in less than two minutes.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-hello-world">Beyond Hello-World</h2>

<p>The power of Node.js comes from the richness of its library ecosystem. There&rsquo;s an NPM package for everything, so you definitely want to use those.</p>

<p>Serverless-function-as-callback imports dependencies in a transparent way. Install the NPM packages of your choice and use them inside the callback:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">import</span> * <span style="color:#00f">as</span> moment from <span style="color:#a31515">&#39;moment&#39;</span>;

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> greeting = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.HttpEventSubscription(<span style="color:#a31515">&#39;greeting&#39;</span>, {
 resourceGroup,
 callback: <span style="color:#2b91af">async</span> (context, req) =&gt; {
   <span style="color:#00f">return</span> {
     status: <span style="color:#2b91af">200</span>,
     body: <span style="color:#a31515">`Hello </span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>req.query[<span style="color:#a31515">&#39;name&#39;</span>] || <span style="color:#a31515">&#39;World&#39;</span><span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515"> at </span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>moment().format(<span style="color:#a31515">&#39;LLLL&#39;</span>)<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">!`</span>
   };
 }
});</code></pre></div>
<p>The packages get zipped up inside the deployment artifact automatically so that the Function App can find them at the startup. So there&rsquo;s no need to manually figure out how to produce the archive, get it uploaded, and maintain it as your libraries get updated.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for another blog post with a full implementation of a serverless URL shortener application deployed into multiple Azure regions for fast response time and improved resiliency.</p>

<h2 id="not-only-http">Not Only HTTP</h2>

<p>Your application might not be a bunch of HTTP functions. You probably want to leverage queues for asynchronous message passing. How about defining a callback on the queue object itself:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> storageAccount = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.storage.Account(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;storage&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   location: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.location</span>,
   accountReplicationType: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;LRS&#34;</span>,
   accountTier: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Standard&#34;</span>,
});

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> queue = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.storage.Queue(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;myqueue&#34;</span>, {
  resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
  storageAccountName: <span style="color:#2b91af">storageAccount.name</span>
});

queue.onEvent(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;newMessage&#34;</span>,  async (context, msg) =&gt; {
   <span style="color:#008000">// code to process &#39;msg&#39; however you want here
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>   console.log(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Message received: &#34;</span> + msg.toString());
});</code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, define a ServiceBus topic and immediately subscribe to the messages:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">import</span> * <span style="color:#00f">as</span> servicebus from <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;@pulumi/azure/eventhub&#34;</span>;

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> namespace = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> servicebus.Namespace(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;test&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   sku: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;standard&#34;</span>,
});

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> topic = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> servicebus.Topic(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;mytopic&#34;</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   namespaceName: <span style="color:#2b91af">namespace.name</span>,
});

<span style="color:#00f">export</span> <span style="color:#00f">const</span> subscription = topic.onEvent(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;mysubscription&#34;</span>, async (context, msg) =&gt; {
   console.log(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Received: &#34;</span> + msg.toString());
});</code></pre></div>
<p>In addition, get notified when a new PNG image is uploaded to a Blob Container:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> storageContainer = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.storage.Container(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;images-container&#34;</span>, {
  resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
  storageAccountName: <span style="color:#2b91af">storageAccount.name</span>,
  name: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;images&#34;</span>,
});

storageContainer.onBlobEvent(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;newImage&#34;</span>, {
   callback: <span style="color:#2b91af">async</span> (context, blob) =&gt; {
       console.log(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;File size: &#34;</span> + context.bindingData.properties.length);
   },
   filterSuffix: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;.png&#34;</span>,
});</code></pre></div>
<p>In all these examples, you get a fully configured Function App on Consumption  Plan ramped up and bound to the trigger of choice. Your callback runs in the cloud handling every event with no manual work of hooking these different components together.</p>

<p>Using a general-purpose language like TypeScript provides one consistent approach to defining and delivering serverless applications and infrastructure as one cohesive application.</p>

<p>We strive to make cloud development as simple as everyday JavaScript development that made the language so successful. A lot is happening behind the scenes, but the code still looks like &ldquo;normal code&rdquo;. Composition of cloud resources should be as straightforward as hooking up components in any traditional application.</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>Pulumi serverless programming model for Azure Functions is just ramping up. There is only a handful of trigger types supported right now, and some configuration parameters are not exposed yet.</p>

<p>So, today is the perfect time to chime in and join the discussion! Help us answer the questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this programming model beneficial to your scenarios?</li>
<li>Which trigger types do you want to be supported?</li>
<li>How should we package multiple functions into Function App(s)?</li>
<li>Do you need input and output bindings to be supported, and if yes, in which shape?</li>
</ul>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Leverage Pulumi for continuous delivery of code and infrastructure to Azure PaaS. An ASP.NET Core application running on App Service and DevOps pipelines.</blockquote>

<p>Pulumi enables developers to define cloud infrastructure using general purpose programming languages. Pulumi works with multiple cloud providers and has first-class support for all services in Microsoft Azure.</p>

<p>Today I want to guide you through the process of developing Pulumi programs to leverage Azure <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-paas/">Platform-as-a-Service</a> (PaaS) services. My language of choice is TypeScript&mdash;a powerful and expressive typed language, which is very familiar to many Azure users.</p>

<h2 id="azure-platform-as-a-service">Azure Platform as a Service</h2>

<p>Azure consists of dozens of cloud services, from VMs to Kubernetes to Serverless. In my experience, a lot of customers choose Azure for its strong portfolio of PaaS-level services.</p>

<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/">Azure App Service</a> is a well-established managed compute offering to run web applications, RESTful APIs, or background workers. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/">Azure SQL Database</a> is a fully managed service to run relational databases with features like high availability and backups available out-of-the-box. Enriched by services like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/">Azure DevOps</a> for CI/CD and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview">Application Insights</a> for APM, PaaS is a powerful way to get the benefits of the cloud without the need to fully re-architect software solutions.</p>

<p>The power of relying on PaaS is evidenced by significant customer adoption. App Service is among the most popular compute services in Azure:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you use automation (ARM, scripts, TF, &hellip;) to define and deploy Azure infrastructure, which services are your primary target? Vote &amp; RT!</p>&mdash; Mikhail Shilkov (@MikhailShilkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikhailShilkov/status/1120592994351099904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Nonetheless, PaaS services pose different challenges to application developers. In particular, the usage of multiple cloud services demands an investment in infrastructure automation. That&rsquo;s where Pulumi comes to the rescue.</p>

<h2 id="a-sample-application">A Sample Application</h2>

<p>For this walkthrough, I took an existing application from Azure Samples GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/azure-samples/dotnetcore-sqldb-tutorial">.NET Core MVC sample for Azure App Service</a>. Predictably enough, it&rsquo;s a Todo List application, and this time it is a web app built with ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core and a SQL database. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-dotnetcore-sqldb">Build an ASP.NET Core and SQL Database app in Azure App Service</a> describes how to deploy such application to Azure App Service by means of clicking buttons in the Azure portal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Friends don&rsquo;t let friends right-click publish</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead, I suggest relying on infrastructure as code. I built a Pulumi program and integrated it into a fully automated build and deployment pipeline in Azure DevOps.</p>

<p>Here is a sketch of the solution:</p>

<p><img src="pulumi-app-service.png" alt="Pulumi and Azure PaaS - Application Diagram" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Pulumi and Azure PaaS - Application Diagram</h4></figcaption>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get started building together!</p>

<h2 id="solution-structure">Solution Structure</h2>

<p>The following snippet shows the essential elements of the solution:</p>

<p>As a first step, I cloned the <a href="https://github.com/azure-samples/dotnetcore-sqldb-tutorial">Todo List app</a> into the <code>src</code> folder. There&rsquo;s nothing specific to Pulumi here: it&rsquo;s just an ASP.NET Core app. It could be your application instead.</p>

<h2 id="bootstrapping-a-pulumi-program">Bootstrapping a Pulumi Program</h2>

<p>The Pulumi development experience is powered by the <a href="https://pulumi.io/reference/commands.html">Pulumi CLI</a>. After <a href="https://pulumi.io/quickstart/install.html">installing the CLI</a>, I jump into an empty <code>infra</code> folder and run <code>pulumi new azure-typescript</code> accepting all the default answers. The CLI bootstraps a skeleton of a TypeScript NodeJS application. The code looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">import</span> * <span style="color:#00f">as</span> pulumi from <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;@pulumi/pulumi&#34;</span>;

<p>The infrastructure pieces are defined by instantiating objects of appropriate types: <code>ResourceGroup</code> and <code>Account</code> in this example.</p>

<h2 id="stacks">Stacks</h2>

<p>If an application is developed to run and evolve for months and years, it&rsquo;s smart to invest in practices like Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It&rsquo;s quite likely that such an application will run in multiple environments: production, staging, development, and so on.</p>

<p>Pulumi comes with a handy concept of <a href="https://pulumi.io/reference/stack.html">stacks</a>&mdash; isolated, independently configurable instances of a Pulumi program. A separate stack can be designated for each deployment environment.</p>

<p>We can take the notion of the stack into the program and apply the stack name to definitions of infrastructure resources:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#008000">// Use first 10 characters of the stackname as prefix for resource names

   location: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;WestUS&#34;</span>,
});

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> resourceGroupArgs = {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   location: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.location</span>,
};

<span style="color:#008000">// Storage Account name must be lowercase and cannot have any dash characters
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span><span style="color:#00f">const</span> storageAccountName = <span style="color:#a31515">`</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>prefix.toLowerCase().replace(<span style="color:#a31515">/-/g</span>, <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;&#34;</span>)<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">sa`</span>;
<span style="color:#00f">const</span> storageAccount = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.storage.Account(storageAccountName, {

   accountKind: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;StorageV2&#34;</span>,
   accountTier: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Standard&#34;</span>,
   accountReplicationType: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;LRS&#34;</span>,
});</code></pre></div>
<p>Note how I use the power of the general purpose programming language to</p>

<ul>
<li>Interact with the environment by reading the stack name</li>
<li>Encode custom rules for resource naming</li>
<li>Work around the shortcomings of the cloud, namely, the restricted set of characters to use in Storage Accounts</li>
<li>Extract the value <code>resourceGroupArgs</code> to reuse the same definition for upcoming resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, the stacks <code>production</code> and <code>dev</code> will be deployed to separate resource groups with clean and consistent naming throughout the resources.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-the-application-to-app-service">Deploying the Application to App Service</h2>

<p>Now, it&rsquo;s time to define the infrastructure to host my ASP.NET Core app. There are three pieces of the puzzle to fit together.</p>

<h3 id="1-app-service-plan">1. App Service Plan</h3>

<p>An App Service Plan defines the pricing tier, instance size and other parameters related to performance, scalability, and cost of the hosted application. My definition is relatively straightforward:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> appServicePlan = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.Plan(<span style="color:#a31515">`</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>prefix<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">-asp`</span>, {
   ...resourceGroupArgs,

   kind: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;App&#34;</span>,

   sku: {
       tier: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;Basic&#34;</span>,
       size: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;B1&#34;</span>,
   },
});</code></pre></div>
<p>In a more advanced scenario, I could provision different performance tiers based on the target environment identified by the stack name.</p>

<h3 id="2-deployment-artifact">2. Deployment Artifact</h3>

<p>App Service is a mature Azure service with a long history, so it has numerous options for deployment methods. Arguably, the newest <a href="https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues/110">Run from Package</a> is the most friendly way to practice Infrastructure as Code automation.</p>

<p>Essentially, I prepare a zip file with the published .NET Core assemblies and upload it to Azure Blob Storage:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> storageContainer = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.storage.Container(<span style="color:#a31515">`</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>prefix<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">-c`</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   storageAccountName: <span style="color:#2b91af">storageAccount.name</span>,
   containerAccessType: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;private&#34;</span>,
});

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> blob = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.storage.ZipBlob(<span style="color:#a31515">`</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>prefix<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">-b`</span>, {
   resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
   storageAccountName: <span style="color:#2b91af">storageAccount.name</span>,
   storageContainerName: <span style="color:#2b91af">storageContainer.name</span>,
   type: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;block&#34;</span>,

   content: <span style="color:#2b91af">new</span> pulumi.asset.FileArchive(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;../src/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/publish.zip&#34;</span>)
});</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="3-app-service">3. App Service</h3>

<p>Now, I can define an App Service and instruct it to use this package to run the website. I do so by linking its application settings to the shared access signature of the blob:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> codeBlobUrl = signedBlobReadUrl(blob, storageAccount, storageContainer);

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> app = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.AppService(<span style="color:#a31515">`</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>prefix<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">-as`</span>, {
   ...resourceGroupArgs,
   appServicePlanId: <span style="color:#2b91af">appServicePlan.id</span>,

   appSettings: {
       <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE&#34;</span>: codeBlobUrl,
   },
});</code></pre></div>
<p>At startup, App Service downloads the zip and mounts it as a local read-only disk to store the application binaries.</p>

<h2 id="adding-a-sql-database">Adding a SQL Database</h2>

<p>The application host is now defined, but I also need a relational database to store and query Todo Items. Staying true to the PaaS path, I&rsquo;m using Azure SQL Database service.</p>

<h3 id="reading-configuration-parameters">Reading Configuration Parameters</h3>

<p>Setting up a SQL Server requires a couple of parameter values that might change between execution environments, for instance, a username and a password for the connection string. Pulumi provides <a href="https://pulumi.io/reference/config.html">a way to configure</a> the program&rsquo;s parameters per stack.</p>

<p>The configuration itself will happen in my CI/CD pipeline. For now, I can query the values with <code>pulumi.Config</code> helper tool:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#008000">// Get the username and the password to use for SQL from config.
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span><span style="color:#00f">const</span> config = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> pulumi.Config();
<span style="color:#00f">const</span> username = config.require(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;sqlUsername&#34;</span>);
<span style="color:#00f">const</span> pwd = config.require(<span style="color:#a31515">&#34;sqlPassword&#34;</span>);</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="azure-sql-server-and-database">Azure SQL Server and Database</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m all set to code the SQL infrastructure. Two resources need to be defined:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> sqlServer = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.sql.SqlServer(<span style="color:#a31515">`</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>prefix<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">-sql`</span>, {
   ...resourceGroupArgs,

   administratorLogin: <span style="color:#2b91af">username</span>,
   administratorLoginPassword: <span style="color:#2b91af">pwd</span>,
   version: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;12.0&#34;</span>,
});

<span style="color:#00f">const</span> database = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.sql.Database(<span style="color:#a31515">`</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>prefix<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">-db`</span>, {
   ...resourceGroupArgs,
   serverName: <span style="color:#2b91af">sqlServer.name</span>,
   requestedServiceObjectiveName: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;S0&#34;</span>
});</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that <code>requestedServiceObjectiveName</code> defines the performance tier and the price of the Azure SQL Database.</p>

<h3 id="wiring-app-service-to-the-database">Wiring App Service to the Database</h3>

<p>By default, Azure SQL Database is configured to deny any incoming connections for security reasons. One approach is to allow access to all Azure services. However, a more secure method is to white-list the Outbound IPs of the App Service:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> firewallRules = app.outboundIpAddresses.apply(
   ips =&gt; ips.split(<span style="color:#a31515">&#39;,&#39;</span>).map(
       ip =&gt; <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.sql.FirewallRule(<span style="color:#a31515">`FR</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>ip<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">`</span>, {
           endIpAddress: <span style="color:#2b91af">ip</span>,
           resourceGroupName: <span style="color:#2b91af">resourceGroup.name</span>,
           serverName: <span style="color:#2b91af">sqlServer.name</span>,
           startIpAddress: <span style="color:#2b91af">ip</span>,
       })
   ));</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that the actual IPs of the service are unknown at the time of writing the program. Nonetheless, the combination of <code>apply</code>, <code>split</code>, and <code>map</code> functions enables me to wire the runtime value of IPs to the proper set of firewall rules.</p>

<p>Additional firewall rules may be implemented to allow administrative access from outside the App Service.</p>

<p>Finally, our ASP.NET Core application expects a connection string with <code>MyDbConnection</code>. To create one, I join the database server and the database name to produce the connection string and add it to the App Service configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> app = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appservice.AppService(<span style="color:#a31515">`</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>prefix<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">-as`</span>, {
   <span style="color:#008000">// ... other parameters as defined above
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>
   connectionStrings: [{
       name: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;MyDbConnection&#34;</span>,
       value:
           <span style="color:#2b91af">pulumi.all</span>([sqlServer.name, database.name]).apply(([server, db]) =&gt;
               <span style="color:#a31515">`Server=tcp:</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>server<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">.database.windows.net;initial catalog=</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>db<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">;user ID=</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>username<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">;password=</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>pwd<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">;Min Pool Size=0;Max Pool Size=30;Persist Security Info=true;`</span>),
       type: <span style="color:#a31515">&#34;SQLAzure&#34;</span>
   }]
});</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="collecting-metrics-with-application-insights">Collecting Metrics with Application Insights</h2>

<p>Application Insights is an Application Performance Management (APM) service to be used for collecting metrics from cloud applications.</p>

<p>After adding Application Insights NuGet packages into my ASP.NET solution, I can go ahead and define the App Insights resource and link it to the App Service with an instrumentation key:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts"><span style="color:#00f">const</span> appInsights = <span style="color:#00f">new</span> azure.appinsights.Insights(<span style="color:#a31515">`</span><span style="color:#a31515">${</span>prefix<span style="color:#a31515">}</span><span style="color:#a31515">-ai`</span>, {

});</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="continuous-deployment-with-azure-devops">Continuous Deployment with Azure DevOps</h2>

<p>While Pulumi CLI works great during development; a production deployment should rather be executed in a CI/CD pipeline. This time I&rsquo;m using Azure DevOps&mdash;a managed CI/CD service to build, test, and deploy cloud applications.</p>

<p>In particular, I defined an Azure Pipeline consisting of three steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build &amp; Publish the .NET Core application;</li>
<li>Restore NPM packages for the infrastructure program;</li>
<li>Provision the cloud infrastructure with Pulumi.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="build-publish-the-net-application">Build &amp; Publish the .NET Application</h3>

<p>The first step utilizes a built-in task which triggers the .NET Core CLI to build the source code in the <code>src</code> folder and publish the assemblies as a zip file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">steps:

<h3 id="restore-npm-packages-for-the-infrastructure-program">Restore NPM packages for the infrastructure program</h3>

<p>The second step is a simple <code>npm install</code> step to restore the NodeJS dependencies:</p>

<h3 id="install-pulumi-and-run-infrastructure-code">Install Pulumi and Run Infrastructure Code</h3>

<p>There is a Pulumi task available in Azure Marketplace: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pulumi.build-and-release-task">Pulumi Azure Pipelines Task</a>. After installing it to your organization, you should be able to utilize a simple task like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"> - task: Pulumi@0
   inputs:

   displayName: <span style="color:#a31515">&#39;Install pulumi and run infra code&#39;</span>
   name: pulumi</code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, if you can&rsquo;t install third-party tasks from Azure Marketplace, you can call the Pulumi CLI from a custom shell script, see <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-appservice-devops/alternative-pipeline/">this pipeline definition</a>.</p>

<p>When everything is wired correctly, I see this screen in Azure DevOps:</p>

<p>Several days ago, I released an update to the <a href="/serverless/coldstarts/">Serverless Cold Starts</a> section of my website. The most significant change to the previous dataset seems to be in how GCP treats idle instances of Google Cloud Functions.</p>

<p>Cold starts are expensive, so all cloud providers preserve a warm instance of a cloud function even when the application is idle. If the function stays unused for an extended period, such idle instance might eventually be recycled.</p>

<p>Azure Functions recycles its instances after 20 minutes of idling. AWS Lambda has no fixed value, but in practice, it&rsquo;s between 25 and 65 minutes of idling.</p>

<h2 id="recycling-of-idle-instances-in-google-cloud-functions">Recycling of Idle Instances in Google Cloud Functions</h2>

<p>The behavior of Google Cloud Functions used to look quite random: an idle instance could survive for 5 hours or die after 5 minutes.</p>

<p>It seems that this chart shows fewer points, but that&rsquo;s deceptive: the points are just much denser and almost all of the responses are warm! Even after 4-5 hours of idling, the instance survives most of the time.</p>

<p>The following chart estimates the probability (Y-axis) of a cold start by the interval between two subsequent requests (X-axis). A higher line means higher chances of an instance being recycled:</p>

<p>While Python and Javascript are in the same ballpark, Go functions seem to survive longer and more reliably.</p>

<h2 id="practical-takeaway">Practical Takeaway</h2>

<p>Cloud providers are fighting the cold starts on many fronts. Now, it seems that Google found a way to keep warm container instances idle for extended periods without too much overhead for their infrastructure.</p>

<p>With this recent improvement, the practice of having a dummy timer-based trigger to keep function instances warm gets less useful. Which is a good thing: less hand-holding and management means more time on developing useful features! One tiny step closer to a serverless nirvana.</p>

<p>In my previous article, <a href="/2019/03/visualizing-cold-starts/">Visualizing Cold Starts</a>, I visually demonstrated the impact of <a href="/serverless/coldstarts/">serverless cold starts</a> on map loading time. When the serverless function serving the map tiles is cold, users experience a noticeable delay before they can see the selected map view.</p>

<p>I then ran the map loading test on  AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions. The duration of the perceptible delay varied between cloud providers, ranging from 1.5 to 8 seconds.</p>

<p>Is this effect unfortunately inherent to all Function-as-a-Service offerings? Or is it possible to avoid cold starts altogether?</p>

<h2 id="binaris">Binaris</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.binaris.com/">Binaris</a> is a new player in the serverless functions market. Binaris removes performance barriers to improve developer productivity and enable any application to be built on top of cloud functions.</p>

<p>One of the clear benefits and differentiators from other providers is the absence of cold starts in Binaris functions:</p>

<p>In light of this, I decided to rerun my map visualization using Binaris functions to illustrate the difference:</p>





<figure style="cursor: pointer">
    <img src="binaris.png" alt="Map loads from Binaris backend" data-alt="binaris.gif">
    <figcaption><h4>Map loads from Binaris backend (click to play or replay)</h4></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The initial map loads immediately after redeployment of the Binaris function, so it would cause a cold start for other providers. There’s no noticeable delay for the Binaris function: All map tiles are loaded after 0.4 seconds, similar to the loading times on subsequent zoom levels during the same test.</p>

<p>In case the warm-up happens during the deployment, I reran the experiment after several hours of inactivity. The idle function would have been &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; by other cloud providers,  but I got no cold start for my Binaris function.</p>

<p>Note that the map tiles are stored in AWS S3. For fairness, the S3 resides in the same region where the Binaris function runs (us-east-1). The client ran on a VM in Azure’s US East region.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-binaris-handle-parallel-requests">How does Binaris handle parallel requests?</h2>

<p>The map control fires 12 parallel requests. Similar to the technique used in my initial <a href="/2019/03/visualizing-cold-starts/">Visualizing Cold Starts</a> article, I modified the function to color-code each tile based on the function’s instance ID and to overlay that ID on the image. This way, it’s easy to see how parallel requests were spread over the instances.</p>

<p>As explained in <a href="/2019/03/concurrency-and-isolation-in-serverless-functions/">Serverless Concurrency Models</a>, Binaris functions can run in two concurrency modes: concurrent or exclusive.</p>

<h3 id="concurrent-mode">Concurrent Mode</h3>

<p>When a Binaris function is configured to run in the concurrent mode, the same instance (a.k.a. <em>function unit</em>) can handle up to 10 requests at the same time. For I/O-bound functions, this can lead to more efficient resource utilization and lower cost.</p>

<p>When running in concurrent mode, a single instance may handle the entire color-coded map:</p>

<p><img src="binaris-concurrent-mode.png" alt="Concurrent Mode" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>The same function unit served all 12 requests concurrently</h4></figcaption>

<p>The maximum concurrency level is currently 10, so some of the tiles in the picture above must have been processed sequentially. Indeed, sometimes it happens that two instances return the tiles for the same view:</p>

<p><img src="binaris-concurrent-mode-mixed.png" alt="Concurrent Mode Mixed" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Two function units served 12 parallel requests</h4></figcaption>

<p>How is the exclusive mode different?</p>

<h3 id="exclusive-mode">Exclusive Mode</h3>

<p>When a Binaris function is set to run in the exclusive mode, each instance handles a single request at a time. Therefore, multiple instances are needed to process concurrent requests.</p>

<p>As expected, the map gets more colorful for functions in the exclusive mode:</p>

<p><img src="binaris-exclusive-mode.png" alt="Exclusive Mode" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Four function units served 12 parallel requests</h4></figcaption>

<p>However, the number of instances doesn’t get close to the number of tiles: 12 tiles are usually served by 3-5 function units. I suspect this is partially explained by the fact that Binaris functions use HTTP/1.1 protocol, and the browser would only open a limited number of connections to the same host:</p>

<p><img src="binaris-http-connections.png" alt="HTTP Connections to Binaris function" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>12 requests are cascaded by Chrome because they connect to the same host</h4></figcaption>

<p>A switch to HTTP/2 would shave some extra latency off the overall map loading time.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>The cold start issue is getting less significant for all cloud providers over time. Binaris may be ahead of others in this race.</p>

<p>My simple test does not necessarily prove the complete absence of cold starts in Binaris functions, but it looks optimistic. I look forward to a world where developers would be able to build applications, including user-facing latency-sensitive ones, out of composable managed serverless functions.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Exploring approaches to sharing or isolating resources between multiple executions of the same cloud function and the associated trade-offs.</blockquote>

<p>Serverless vendors have different approaches when it comes to sharing or isolating resources between multiple executions of the same cloud function. In this article, I&rsquo;ll explore the execution concurrency models of three FaaS offerings and the associated trade-offs.</p>

<h2 id="aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</h2>

<p>AWS Lambda executions are always entirely isolated from each other. Simple enough, right?</p>

<p>A function execution maps 1:1 to a function instance. Each execution runs on a separate host, i.e., a dedicated container with its own instance of the runtime. All the resources of this host (CPU, RAM, scratch disk space) are dedicated solely to this execution.</p>

<p>AWS Lambda spins up as many hosts as needed to process all concurrent requests:</p>

<p><img src="isolated-executions.png" alt="Isolated Executions in AWS Lambda" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>3 overlapping executions running on 3 isolated hosts</h4></figcaption>
 

<p>This model has a benefit of predictability: The resource manager allocates the same amount of resources to each execution. Therefore, the variability between executions is low (with the cold start being a remarkable exception).</p>

<p>Resource allocation has to be preconfigured by selecting the memory limit. CPU cycles are allocated proportionally to RAM. Performance variation might increase for smaller instance sizes: 128 MB instances are empirically known to be less consistent.</p>

<p>In terms of pricing, the executions are independent. The bill consists of two parts: a fixed fee per execution and a variable charge for execution duration, measured in GB-seconds:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;allocated instance size in GB&gt; * &lt;duration of execution rounded up to 100ms&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, if each execution has 1 GB of allocated RAM and runs for 1 second, the total bill will be 3 GB-seconds.</p>

<p>This model works but is definitely better for some workloads than others.</p>

<h2 id="i-o-bound-workloads">I/O Bound Workloads</h2>

<p>Typically, enterprise workloads are not very demanding to CPU (not much computation other than serialization and conversions) and RAM (mostly consumed by the runtime and libraries since functions are stateless). Many functions end up calling other resources synchronously over the network: managed cloud services, databases, and web APIs. This means the execution duration is mainly determined by the response time of those resources.</p>

<p>AWS would charge for the full execution time, even if 90% of the time were spent waiting for an external response. In this case, the resources dedicated to the execution are basically wasted.</p>

<p>Ben Kehoe argued for <a href="https://read.acloud.guru/the-need-for-asynchronous-rpc-architecture-in-serverless-systems-ff168f1c8785">the need for asynchronous FaaS call chains in serverless systems</a> almost 2 years ago, but, unfortunately, the situation is still the same.</p>

<h2 id="resource-pooling">Resource Pooling</h2>

<p>In the ideal world of greenfield projects, serverless functions would only be purely transforming inputs to outputs or would make external calls that respond fast and don’t require keeping any state between the requests.</p>

<p>However, in the real world, you’re often required to access traditional SQL databases, such as Postgres or SQL Server. Database connection protocols were not designed for today’s serverless services with hundreds of stateless short-lived single-execution hosts. Connections are expensive to establish. There is a limit of how many of them the database can handle. Therefore, the client should strive to reuse the connections as much as possible.</p>

<p>Good examples of these issues and possible workarounds are shown in these great posts by Jeremy Daly:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/reuse-database-connections-aws-lambda/">How To: Reuse Database Connections in AWS Lambda</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/manage-rds-connections-aws-lambda/">How To: Manage RDS Connections from AWS Lambda Serverless Functions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremydaly/serverless-mysql">Serverless MySQL</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A smaller scale version of the same problem applies to HTTP-based communication: reuse of DNS lookups, TCP connections, etc.</p>

<p>Obviously, it would help if multiple executions of a function shared the pool of database and TCP connections.</p>

<h2 id="azure-functions">Azure Functions</h2>

<p>Azure Functions tried to address this issue by separating the notion of executions and instances. In the Azure world, an instance is a host with dedicated resources (both CPU and RAM allocations are fixed and not currently configurable). Each instance is then capable of running multiple executions at the same time and reusing the resources for all of them.</p>

<p>If we apply the Azure model to the example of the 3 overlapping executions we discussed in the AWS section, we can quickly see how they differ:</p>

<p><img src="concurrent-executions.png" alt="Concurrent Executions in Azure Functions" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>3 overlapping executions running on a single host</h4></figcaption>

<p>In this case, the executions share the common pool of resources by running at the same host.</p>

<p>The potential efficiency is also reflected in the reduced bill: You&rsquo;re charged for a merged window of the parallel invocations. If 1 GB of memory is consumed (regardless if 1, 2, or 3 executions are active), then the total bill for 3 executions is 1.5 GB-seconds, where 1.5s is the time between the start of the first execution and the end of the last execution. That&rsquo;s 2x cheaper compared to AWS Lambda.</p>

<p>This calculation might not be accurate for very short executions or many concurrent executions. The minimum time charge is always 100 ms, and 0.125 GB is the minimum memory charge. For that reason, a single execution can’t be less than 0.0125 GB-seconds.</p>

<p>In the example above, sharing resources is lean and beneficial to the end customer. However, it might be problematic in the case of CPU-bound workloads; see <a href="https://blog.binaris.com/from-0-to-1000-instances/#azure-2">Bcrypt/Azure example in How Serverless Providers Scale Queue Processing</a>.</p>

<p>Another benefit of concurrent executions is the potential for reuse of SQL connection pools and HTTP clients. For instance, an Azure Function implemented in C# shares the same .NET process for concurrent executions. Therefore, any static objects are reused automatically.</p>

<h2 id="configuring-concurrency-in-azure-functions">Configuring Concurrency in Azure Functions</h2>

<p>We have now established a clear trade-off between resource allocation efficiency and performance guarantees. Now that we understand the basics of concurrent executions, you might be wondering how Azure Functions decide how many executions to put into a single instance.</p>

<p>The truth is, there isn’t one clear answer. It’s a combination of decisions made by the <a href="https://blog.binaris.com/from-0-to-1000-instances/#azure">Scale Controller</a> and configuration knobs. It also depends on the type of the event triggering the execution.</p>

<p>For Azure Functions that are triggered by queue messages, there are settings <code>batchSize</code> and <code>newBatchThreshold</code>. The maximum number of concurrent executions is then derived from the simple equation <code>batchSize + newBatchThreshold</code>.</p>

<p>Cosmos DB and Event Hubs triggers invoke one function execution per batch of items. Each batch is tied to one partition in the event source. The concurrency is then determined at runtime by the Scale Controller based on factors, such as the number of partitions and the metrics reported from existing instances.</p>

<p>HTTP Functions are the marriage of these two approaches. There is a setting, <code>maxConcurrentRequests</code>, that can be used to limit the concurrency explicitly. It defaults to <code>200</code> concurrent requests, which is quite generous. In practice, it’s not likely to reach that level of execution concurrency unless they are idle for minutes. Most commonly, the Scale Controller creates new instances of the function before the maximum limit is exhausted, which may improve the response time but will incur a higher bill.</p>

<h2 id="binaris">Binaris</h2>

<p>Binaris has support for both modes: AWS Lambda-esque exclusive invocations or concurrent invocations similar to Azure Functions. The user decides which one to use by changing a simple setting in the <code>binaris.yml</code> file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yml">functions:
  NewCreate:
    file: function.js
    entrypoint: handler
    executionModel: concurrent
    runtime: node8
</code></pre>

<p>When <code>executionModel</code> is set to <code>exclusive</code>, the Binaris runtime limits the concurrency of each &ldquo;function unit&rdquo; (container) to one.</p>

<p>Alternatively, when <code>executionModel</code> is set to <code>concurrent</code>, Binaris enables the shared execution model, which allows for re-entrant invocations on the same function unit. The current model allows for up to 10 concurrent invocations within a single unit (the number will be configurable in the future). All re-entrant invocations share the same memory, disk space, and available vCPU.</p>

<p>Binaris charges a flat rate for each millisecond of running time. The rate does not depend on whether a single execution is running or if there are multiple executions running on the same instance.</p>

<p>There is no configuration for instance CPU or RAM allocation. The price of 1 second of execution is equivalent to what AWS charges for 1 GB instances. In the example above, the customer is charged for 1.5 seconds of execution time.</p>

<p>The granularity is always 1 ms, and there is no minimum charge, which may make a big difference for short executions compared to the minimum of 100 ms for AWS and Azure. This makes Binaris very competitive for quick functions: If 10 parallel executions complete within 10 ms, the total charge is 100 times less compared to AWS Lambda.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Sharing compute resources between concurrent executions of serverless functions can be beneficial for I/O-bound workloads. During the periods when some executions are idle waiting for a response from the network, other executions may continue to use the allocated resources. This shareability also applies to assets, such as database connections and libraries loaded into the instance’s memory.</p>

<p>The shared execution model allows for more efficient use of hardware resources, which, in turn, leads to a lower bill.</p>

<p>However, concurrency can also lead to resource contention for CPU-intensive workloads, which might negatively affect the performance of serverless functions. Thus, until cloud providers come up with a perfect method of optimizing concurrency at runtime, it&rsquo;s essential to give the function owner control over the concurrency mode. Given a simple knob, they can make a judgment call between concurrency and isolation.</p>

<p>The team collects the stats of cold starts internally, and their numbers were lower than mine. We started an e-mail thread to reconcile the results. I won&rsquo;t publish any messages from the private thread, but I&rsquo;m posting the main findings below.</p>

<h2 id="check-the-deployment-method">Check the deployment method</h2>

<p>For my tests, I&rsquo;ve been using &ldquo;Run from external package&rdquo; deployment method, where the function deployment artifact is stored as a zip file on blob storage. This method is the most friendly for automation and infrastructure-as-code pipelines.</p>

<p>Apparently, it also increases the cold start duration. I believe the situation already improved since my original article, but here are the current numbers from mid-March.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t really recommend &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use Application Insights&rdquo; because the telemetry service is vital in most scenarios. Anyway, keep this fact in mind and watch <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/issues/4183">the corresponding issue</a>.</p>

<h2 id="keep-bugging-the-team">Keep bugging the team</h2>

<p>While you can use the information above, the effect is still going to be limited. Obviously, the power to reduce the cold starts lies within the Azure Functions engineering team.</p>

<p>Coincidence or not, the numbers have already significantly improved since early February, and <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/issues/4184">more work</a> is <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/commit/792bb463b4bc48d67570d5b44b69c89b9d43f86d">in progress</a>.</p>

<p>I consider this to be a part of my mission: spotlighting the issues in public gives that nudge to prioritize performance improvements over other backlog items.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the data in <a href="/serverless/coldstarts/azure/">Cold Starts in Azure Functions</a> and <a href="/serverless/coldstarts/big3/">Comparison of Cold Starts in Serverless Functions across AWS, Azure, and GCP</a> are updated: I&rsquo;m keeping them up-to-date as promised before.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Serverless cold starts illustrated with animated GIFs.</blockquote>

<p>I <a href="/serverless/coldstarts/">wrote a lot</a> about cold starts of serverless functions. The articles are full of charts and numbers which are hopefully useful but might be hard to internalize. I decided to come up with a way to represent colds starts visually.</p>

<p>I created HTTP functions that serve geographic maps (map credit <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">Open Street Map</a>). The map is a combination of small square tiles; each tile is 256 by 256 pixels. My selected map view consists of 12 tiles, so 12 requests are made to the serverless function to load a single view.</p>

<p>During each experiment, I load the map and then zoom-in three times. The very first view hits  the function in a cold state. Subsequently, the zoomed views are loaded from the warm function. There is a timer next to the map which shows the total time elapsed since the beginning until the last tile arrives.</p>

<h2 id="cold-starts-visualized">Cold Starts Visualized</h2>

<p>All functions are implemented in Node.js and run in the geographically closest region to me (West Europe).</p>

<p>The functions load map tiles from the cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage). So the duration is increased by loading SDK at startup and the storage read latency.</p>

<h3 id="aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</h3>

<p>The following GIF movie is a recording of the experiment against an AWS Lambda:</p>





<figure style="cursor: pointer">
    <img src="aws.png" alt="Map loads from AWS Lambda backend" data-alt="aws.gif">
    <figcaption><h4>Map loads from AWS Lambda backend (click to play or replay)</h4></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The cold view took 1.9 seconds to load, while the warm views were between 200 and 600 milliseconds. The distinction is fairly visible but not extremely annoying: the first load feels like a small network glitch.</p>

<h3 id="google-cloud-functions">Google Cloud Functions</h3>

<p>This GIF shows the experiment against a Google Cloud Function:</p>





<figure style="cursor: pointer">
    <img src="gcp.png" alt="Map loads from Google Cloud Functions backend" data-alt="gcp.gif">
    <figcaption><h4>Map loads from Google Cloud Functions backend (click to play or replay)</h4></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Loading the initial view took an extra second compared to AWS. It&rsquo;s not a dealbreaker, but the delay of 3 seconds is often quoted as psychologically important.</p>

<p>The tiles seem to appear more gradually; read more on that below.</p>

<h3 id="azure-functions">Azure Functions</h3>

<p>Here is another movie, this time for an Azure Function:</p>





<figure style="cursor: pointer">
    <img src="azure.png" alt="Map loads from Azure Functions backend" data-alt="azure.gif">
    <figcaption><h4>Map loads from Azure Functions backend (click to play or replay)</h4></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As expected from my previously published measurements, Azure Functions take significantly longer to start. A user has enough time to start wondering whether the map is broken.</p>

<p>I expect better results from Functions implemented in C#, but that would not be an apples-to-apples comparison.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-providers-handle-parallel-requests">How do providers handle parallel requests?</h2>

<p>The map control fires 12 requests in parallel. All functions talk HTTP/2, so the old limit on the number of connections does not apply. Let&rsquo;s compare how those parallel requests are processed.</p>

<h3 id="aws-lambda-1">AWS Lambda</h3>

<p>Each instance of AWS Lambda can handle a single request at a time. So, instead of hitting just one cold start, we hit 12 cold starts in parallel. To illustrate this, I’ve modified the function to color-code each tile based on the Lambda instance ID and to print that ID on the image:</p>

<p><img src="aws-colored.png" alt="AWS Map Colored" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>AWS Lambda provisioned 12 instances to serve 12 requests in parallel</h4></figcaption>

<p>Effectively, the measured durations represent the roundtrip time for <em>the slowest out of 12 parallel requests</em>. It&rsquo;s not the average or median duration of the cold start.</p>

<h3 id="google-cloud-functions-1">Google Cloud Functions</h3>

<p>Google uses the same one-execution-per-instance model, so I expected GCP Cloud Functions to behave precisely the same as AWS Lambda. However, I was wrong:</p>

<p><img src="gcp-colored.png" alt="GCP Map Colored" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Google Cloud Function provisioned 3 instances to serve 12 parallel requests</h4></figcaption>

<p>Only three instances were created, and two of them handled multiple requests. It looks like GCP serializes the incoming requests and spreads them through a limited set of instances.</p>

<h3 id="azure-functions-1">Azure Functions</h3>

<p>Azure Functions have a different design: each instance of a function can handle multiple parallel requests at the same time. Thus, in theory, all 12 tiles could be served by the first instance created after the cold start.</p>

<p>In practice, multiple instances are created. The picture looks very similar to GCP:</p>

<p><img src="azure-colored.png" alt="Azure Map Colored" /></p>

<figcaption><h4>Azure Function provisioned 4 instances to serve 12 parallel requests</h4></figcaption>

<p>There were four active instances, but the same one handled 9 out of 12 requests. This behavior seems to be quite consistent between multiple runs.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope that these visualizations are useful to get a better feel of the cold starts in serverless functions.</p>

<p>However, they are just examples. Don&rsquo;t treat the numbers as exact statistics for a given cloud provider. If you are curious, you can learn more in <a href="/serverless/coldstarts/">Serverless Cold Starts</a> series of articles.</p>

<p>This article describes AWS Lambda&mdash;the dynamically scaled and billed-per-execution compute service. Instances of Lambdas are added and removed dynamically. When a new instance handles its first request, the response time increases, which is called a <strong>cold start</strong>.</p>

<p>This article describes Azure Functions running on Consumption Plan&mdash;the dynamically scaled and billed-per-execution compute service. Consumption Plan adds and removes instances dynamically. When a new instance handles its first request, the response time increases, which is called a <strong>cold start</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="when-does-cold-start-happen">When Does Cold Start Happen?</h2>

<p>The very first cold start happens when the first request comes in after deployment.</p>

<p>After that request is processed, the instance stays alive for about <strong>20 minutes</strong> to be reused for subsequent requests:</p>

<p>This article describes Google Cloud Functions&mdash;the dynamically scaled and billed-per-execution compute service. Instances of Cloud Functions are added and removed dynamically. When a new instance handles its first request, the response time suffers, which is called a <strong>cold start</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="when-does-cold-start-happen">When Does Cold Start Happen?</h2>

<p>The very first cold start happens when the first request comes in after deployment.</p>

<p>After that request is processed, the instance stays alive to be reused for subsequent requests. There is no predefined threshold for instance recycling: the empiric data show a high variance of idle-but-alive periods.</p>

<p>The following chart estimates the probability of an instance to be recycled after the given period of inactivity:</p>

<p>Google Cloud Functions have a setting to define the memory size that gets allocated to a single instance of a function. Are larger instances faster to load?</p>

<p>This article compares Function-as-a-Service offerings of Big-3 cloud providers in terms of cold starts. AWS Lambda, Azure Functions (Consumption Plan), and Google Cloud Functions are all dynamically scaled and billed-per-execution compute services. Instances of cloud functions are added and removed dynamically. When a new instance handles its first request, the response time increases, which is called a <strong>cold start</strong>.</p>

<p>Read more: <a href="/serverless/coldstarts/define/">Cold Starts in Serverless Functions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="when-does-cold-start-happen">When Does Cold Start Happen?</h2>

<p>The very first cold start happens when the first request comes in after deployment.</p>

<p>After that request is processed, the instance stays alive to be reused for subsequent requests.</p>

<p>The strategy for reuse differs very between the cloud vendors:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Service</th>
<th>Idle instance lifetime</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>AWS Lambda</td>
<td>Mostly between 25 and 65 minutes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Azure Functions</td>
<td>20 minutes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Google Cloud Functions</td>
<td>Anywhere between 3 minutes and 5+ hours</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Only Azure has the policy to recycle an idle instance after a fixed period. AWS, and especially GCP, employ some other strategies to determine the threshold, potentially based on the current demand-supply balance of their resource pools.</p>

<p>In the past 6 months I published several blog posts under the same theme of comparing the serverless services of the top cloud providers in terms of their performance and scalability properties:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war/">Serverless: Cold Start War</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing/">From 0 to 1000 Instances: How Serverless Providers Scale Queue Processing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/">Serverless at Scale: Serving StackOverflow-like Traffic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I received some very positive feedback on those posts (readers are fantastic!). On top of that, people always had great suggestions about improving and extending the contents of those articles. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about them.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-of-a-blog-post">Limitations of a blog post</h2>

<p>However, the format of a blog post is limited in several important ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Read-only</strong>. Once it&rsquo;s published, it&rsquo;s published. Except for some typos, I never make changes or extend the past articles. Despite the lack of technical limitations, re-writing blog posts doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a part of the genre. If I want to add another cloud, do I change the old post or create an entirely new one?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Point-in-time</strong>. All those articles are heavily data-driven: numbers, charts, comparisons. The value of the data decreases as time goes. Readers can&rsquo;t trust the 2-years-old numbers in the ever-changing world of the cloud.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Wall of text</strong>. A blog post is just a chunk of text interrupted by images and charts. People read it from top to bottom. There&rsquo;s no other structure to it. So, I have to come up with the best sequence of material to present. I have to balance the length of the post to give enough insight but not to be too long and tedious. There&rsquo;s no good way to summarize something and then send curious readers to the details.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Same for everyone</strong>. Readers might have different backgrounds. Somebody only cares about one cloud provider or one language because that&rsquo;s what they work with. Others look for brief comparison and industry-wide trends. Nonetheless, they all have to read the same text.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Not reproducible</strong>. Because of the previous points, there is no real incentive to make the experiments reproducible. It&rsquo;s enough to run it once, publish the results, and forget. However, this means that the effort is lost, and there is no open code that others could use.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to have a shot at addressing these issues.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-solve-these-problems">How to solve these problems</h2>

<p>I believe I can solve the issues inherent to the format of the blog by doing the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Automate the experiments</strong>. Provision the required infrastructure, run the workload, collect metrics, record the data, aggregate them, and publish the charts. All programmatically, without significant human intervention.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Run more often</strong>. Re-do the experiments every month or so. Compare the results over time, detect any trends.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Website not blog</strong>. Publish the results as a set of pages with different perspectives on the related data. Make it compelling for multiple types of audience.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Keep it up-to-date</strong>. Make sure that people can trust the data as being actual, not old or obsolete.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Open everything</strong>. Publish the code behind the experiments, the raw data, the aggregated data. Enable people to find bugs, flaws, and suggest improvements&mdash;if they want to.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-s-available-today">What&rsquo;s available today</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve completed all the suggestions for the topic of <a href="/serverless/coldstarts/">Cold Starts</a>:</p>

</a></p>

<p>Two dozens of cloud functions span across three providers. The experiments run for a week and then the results are saved as JSON files. A script aggregates the data and produces charts in several seconds.</p>

<p>I commit to running this experiment and updating the data at least once in 2 months for as long as it would make sense, to my judgment.</p>

<p>The corresponding section of the website consists of 16 pages with different focus and level of details.</p>

        <title>From YAML to TypeScript: Developer's View on Cloud Automation</title>
        <link href="https://mikhail.io/2019/02/from-yaml-to-typescript-developers-view-on-cloud-automation/"/>
        <updated>2019-02-14T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <id>tag:mikhail.io,2019-02-14,/2019/02/from-yaml-to-typescript-developers-view-on-cloud-automation/</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The rise of managed cloud services, cloud-native and serverless applications brings both new possibilities and challenges. More and more practices from software development process like version control, code review, continuous integration, and automated testing are applied to the cloud infrastructure provisioning.</p>
<p>Most existing tools suggest defining infrastructure in text-based markup formats. In this article, I&#39;m making a case for using real programming languages like TypeScript instead. Such a change makes even more software development practices applicable to the infrastructure realm.</p>
<h2 id="sample-application">Sample Application</h2>
<p>It&#39;s easier to make a case given a specific example. For this article, I define a URL Shortener application, a basic clone of tinyurl.com or bit.ly. There is an administrative page where one can define short aliases for long URLs:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/02/from-yaml-to-typescript-developers-view-on-cloud-automation/url-shortener.png" alt="URL Shortener sample app"></p>
<figcaption>URL Shortener sample app</figcaption>

<p>Now, whenever somebody goes to the base URL of the application + an existing alias, they get redirected to the full URL.</p>
<p>This app is simple to describe but involves enough moving parts to be representative of some real-world issues. As a bonus, there are many existing implementations on the web to compare with.</p>
<h2 id="serverless-url-shortener">Serverless URL Shortener</h2>
<p>I&#39;m a big proponent of the serverless architecture: the style of cloud applications being a combination of serverless functions and managed cloud services. They are fast to develop, effortless to run and cost pennies unless the application gets lots of users. However, even serverless applications require infrastructure provisioning, like databases, queues, and other sources of events and destinations of data.</p>
<p>My examples are going to use Amazon AWS, but this could be Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform too.</p>
<p>So, the gist is to store URLs with short names as key-value pairs in Amazon DynamoDB and use AWS Lambdas to run the application code. Here is the initial sketch:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/02/from-yaml-to-typescript-developers-view-on-cloud-automation/lambda-dynamodb.png" alt="URL Shortener with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB"></p>
<figcaption>URL Shortener with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB</figcaption>

<p>The Lambda on the top receives an event when somebody decides to add a new URL. It extracts the name and the URL from the request and saves them as an item in the DynamoDB table.</p>
<p>The Lambda at the bottom is called when a user navigates to a short URL. The code reads the full URL based on the requested path and returns a 301 response with the corresponding location.</p>
<p>Here is the implementation of the <code>Open URL</code> Lambda in JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const aws = require(&#39;aws-sdk&#39;);
const table = new aws.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

exports.handler = async (event) =&gt; {
  const name = event.path.substring(1);

  const params = { TableName: &quot;urls&quot;, Key: { &quot;name&quot;: name } };
  const value = await table.get(params).promise();

  const url = value &amp;&amp; value.Item &amp;&amp; value.Item.url;
  return url 
    ? { statusCode: 301, body: &quot;&quot;, headers: { &quot;Location&quot;: url } }
    : { statusCode: 404, body: name + &quot; not found&quot; };
};</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s 11 lines of code. I&#39;ll skip the implementation of <code>Add URL</code> function because it&#39;s very similar. Considering a third function to list the existing URLs for UI, we might have 30-40 lines of JavaScript in total.</p>
<p>So, how do we deploy the application?</p>
<p>Well, before we do that, we should realize that the above picture was an over-simplification.</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Lambda can&#39;t handle HTTP requests directly, so we need to add AWS API Gateway in front of it.</li>
<li>We also need to serve some static files for the UI, which we&#39;ll put into AWS S3 and front it with the same API Gateway.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the updated diagram:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/02/from-yaml-to-typescript-developers-view-on-cloud-automation/apigateway-lambda-dynamodb-s3.png" alt="API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3"></p>
<figcaption>API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3</figcaption>

<p>This is a viable design, but the details are even more complicated:</p>
<ul>
<li>API Gateway is a complex beast which needs Stages, Deployments, and REST Endpoints to be appropriately configured.</li>
<li>Permissions and policies need to be defined so that API Gateway could call Lambda and Lambda could access DynamoDB.</li>
<li>Static Files should go to S3 Bucket Objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the actual setup involves a couple of dozen objects to be configured in AWS:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/02/from-yaml-to-typescript-developers-view-on-cloud-automation/apigateway-lambda-dynamodb-s3-details.png" alt="Cloud resources to be provisioned"></p>
<figcaption>Cloud resources to be provisioned</figcaption>

<p>How do we approach this task?</p>
<h2 id="options-to-provision-the-infrastructure">Options to Provision the Infrastructure</h2>
<p>There are many options to provision a cloud application, each one has its trade-offs. Let&#39;s quickly go through the list of possibilities to understand the landscape.</p>
<h2 id="aws-web-console">AWS Web Console</h2>
<p>AWS, like any other cloud, has a <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com">web user interface</a> to configure its resources:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/02/from-yaml-to-typescript-developers-view-on-cloud-automation/aws-web-console.png" alt="AWS Web Console"></p>
<figcaption>AWS Web Console</figcaption>

<p>That&#39;s a decent place to start&mdash;good for experimenting, figuring out the available options, following the tutorials, i.e., for exploration.</p>
<p>However, it doesn&#39;t suit particularly well for long-lived ever-changing applications developed in teams. A manually clicked deployment is pretty hard to reproduce in the exact manner, which becomes a maintainability issue pretty fast.</p>
<h2 id="aws-command-line-interface">AWS Command Line Interface</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS Command Line Interface</a> (CLI) is a unified tool to manage all AWS services from a command prompt. You write the calls like</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">aws apigateway create-rest-api --name &#39;My First API&#39; --description &#39;This is my first API&#39;

aws apigateway create-stage --rest-api-id 1234123412 --stage-name &#39;dev&#39; --description &#39;Development stage&#39; --deployment-id a1b2c3</code></pre>
<p>The initial experience might not be as smooth as clicking buttons in the browser, but the huge benefit is that you can <em>reuse</em> commands that you once wrote. You can build scripts by combining many commands into cohesive scenarios. So, your colleague can benefit from the same script that you created. You can provision multiple environments by parameterizing the scripts.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, I&#39;ve never done that for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>CLI scripts feel too imperative to me. I have to describe &quot;how&quot; to do things, not &quot;what&quot; I want to get in the end.</li>
<li>There seems to be no good story for updating existing resources. Do I write small delta scripts for each change? Do I have to keep them forever and run the full suite every time I need a new environment?</li>
<li>If a failure occurs mid-way through the script, I need to manually repair everything to a consistent state. This gets messy real quick, and I have no desire to exercise this process, especially in production.</li>
</ul>
<p>To overcome such limitations, the notion of the <strong>Desired State Configuration</strong> (DSC) was invented. Under this paradigm, one describes the desired layout of the infrastructure, and then the tooling takes care of either provisioning it from scratch or applying the required changes to an existing environment.</p>
<p>Which tool provides DSC model for AWS? There are legions.</p>
<h2 id="aws-cloudformation">AWS CloudFormation</h2>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a> is the first-party tool for Desired State Configuration management from Amazon. CloudFormation templates use YAML to describe all the infrastructure resources of AWS.</p>
<p>Here is a snippet from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/build-a-serverless-private-url-shortener/">a private URL shortener example</a> kindly provided at AWS blog:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">Resources:
  S3BucketForURLs:
    Type: &quot;AWS::S3::Bucket&quot;
    DeletionPolicy: Delete
    Properties:
      BucketName: !If [ &quot;CreateNewBucket&quot;, !Ref &quot;AWS::NoValue&quot;, !Ref S3BucketName ]
      WebsiteConfiguration:
        IndexDocument: &quot;index.html&quot;
      LifecycleConfiguration:
        Rules:
          -
            Id: DisposeShortUrls
            ExpirationInDays: !Ref URLExpiration
            Prefix: &quot;u&quot;
            Status: Enabled</code></pre>
<p>This is just a very short fragment: the complete example consists of 317 lines YAML. That&#39;s an order of magnitude more than the actual JavaScript code that we have in the application!</p>
<p>CloudFormation is a powerful tool, but it demands quite some learning to be done to master it. Moreover, it&#39;s specific to AWS: you won&#39;t be able to transfer the skill to other cloud providers.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be great if there was a universal DSC format? Meet Terraform.</p>
<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.terraform.io/">HashiCorp Terraform</a> is an open source tool to define infrastructure in declarative configuration files. It has a pluggable architecture, so the tool supports all major clouds and even hybrid scenarios.</p>
<p>The custom text-based Terraform <code>.tf</code> format is used to define the configurations. The templating language is quite powerful, and once you learn it, you can use it for different cloud providers.</p>
<p>Here is a snippet from <a href="https://github.com/jamesridgway/aws-lambda-short-url">AWS Lambda Short URL Generator</a> example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-tf">resource &quot;aws_api_gateway_rest_api&quot; &quot;short_urls_api_gateway&quot; {
  name        = &quot;Short URLs API&quot;
  description = &quot;API for managing short URLs.&quot;
}
resource &quot;aws_api_gateway_usage_plan&quot; &quot;short_urls_admin_api_key_usage_plan&quot; {
  name         = &quot;Short URLs admin API key usage plan&quot;
  description  = &quot;Usage plan for the admin API key for Short URLS.&quot;
  api_stages {
    api_id = &quot;${aws_api_gateway_rest_api.short_urls_api_gateway.id}&quot;
    stage  = &quot;${aws_api_gateway_deployment.short_url_api_deployment.stage_name}&quot;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>This time, the complete example is around 450 lines of textual templates. Are there ways to reduce the size of the infrastructure definition?</p>
<p>Yes, by raising the level of abstraction. It&#39;s possible with Terraform&#39;s modules, or by using other, more specialized tools.</p>
<h2 id="serverless-framework-and-sam">Serverless Framework and SAM</h2>
<p><a href="https://serverless.com/">The Serverless Framework</a> is an infrastructure management tool focused on serverless applications. It works across cloud providers (AWS support is the strongest though) and only exposes features related to building applications with cloud functions.</p>
<p>The benefit is that it&#39;s much more concise. Once again, the tool is using YAML to define the templates, here is the snippet from <a href="https://github.com/danielireson/serverless-url-shortener">Serverless URL Shortener</a> example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">functions:
  store:
    handler: api/store.handle
    events:
      - http:
          path: /
          method: post
          cors: true</code></pre>
<p>The domain-specific language yields a shorter definition: this example has 45 lines of YAML + 123 lines of JavaScript functions.</p>
<p>However, the conciseness has a flip side: as soon as you veer outside of the fairly &quot;thin&quot; golden path&mdash;the cloud functions and an incomplete list of event sources&mdash;you have to fall back to more generic tools like CloudFormation. As soon as your landscape includes lower-level infrastructure work or some container-based components, you&#39;re stuck using multiple config languages and tools again.</p>
<p>Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/index.html">AWS Serverless Application Model</a> (SAM) looks very similar to the Serverless Framework but tailored to be AWS-specific.</p>
<p>Is that the end game? I don&#39;t think so.</p>
<h2 id="desired-properties-of-infrastructure-definition-tool">Desired Properties of Infrastructure Definition Tool</h2>
<p>So what have we learned while going through the existing landscape? The perfect infrastructure tools should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide <strong>reproducible</strong> results of deployments</li>
<li>Be <strong>scriptable</strong>, i.e., require no human intervention after the definition is complete</li>
<li>Define <strong>desired state</strong> rather than exact steps to achieve it</li>
<li>Support <strong>multiple cloud providers</strong> and hybrid scenarios</li>
<li>Be <strong>universal</strong> in the sense of using the same tool to define any type of resource</li>
<li>Be <strong>succinct</strong> and <strong>concise</strong> to stay readable and manageable</li>
<li><del>Use YAML-based format</del></li>
</ul>
<p>Nah, I crossed out the last item. YAML seems to be the most popular language among this class of tools (and I haven&#39;t even touched Kubernetes yet!), but I&#39;m not convinced it works well for me. <a href="https://noyaml.com/">YAML has many flaws, and I just don&#39;t want to use it</a>.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that I haven&#39;t mentioned <strong>Infrastructure as code</strong> a single time yet? Well, here we go (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">Wikipedia</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shouldn&#39;t it be called &quot;Infrastructure as definition files&quot;, or &quot;Infrastructure as YAML&quot;?</p>
<p>As a software developer, what I really want is &quot;Infrastructure as actual code, you know, the program thing&quot;. I want to use <strong>the same language</strong> that I already know. I want to stay in the same editor. I want to get IntelliSense <strong>auto-completion</strong> when I type. I want to see the <strong>compilation errors</strong> when what I typed is not syntactically correct. I want to reuse the <strong>developer skills</strong> that I already have. I want to come up with <strong>abstractions</strong> to generalize my code and create <strong>reusable components</strong>. I want to <strong>leverage open-source community</strong> who would create much better components than I ever could. I want to <strong>combine the code and infrastructure</strong> in one code project.</p>
<p>If you are with me on that, keep reading. You get all of that with <a href="https://pulumi.io/">Pulumi</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pulumi">Pulumi</h2>
<p><a href="https://pulumi.io/">Pulumi</a> is a tool to build cloud-based software using real programming languages. They support all major cloud providers, plus Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Pulumi programming model supports Go and Python too, but I&#39;m going to use TypeScript for the rest of the article.</p>
<p>While prototyping a URL shortener, I explain the fundamental way of working and illustrate the benefits and some trade-offs. If you want to follow along, <a href="https://pulumi.io/quickstart/install.html">install Pulumi</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-pulumi-works">How Pulumi Works</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s start defining our URL shortener application in TypeScript. I installed <code>@pulumi/pulumi</code> and <code>@pulumi/aws</code> NPM modules so that I can start the program. The first resource to create is a DynamoDB table:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">import * as aws from &quot;@pulumi/aws&quot;;

// A DynamoDB table with a single primary key
let counterTable = new aws.dynamodb.Table(&quot;urls&quot;, {
    name: &quot;urls&quot;,
    attributes: [
        { name: &quot;name&quot;, type: &quot;S&quot; },
    ],
    hashKey: &quot;name&quot;,
    readCapacity: 1,
    writeCapacity: 1
});</code></pre>
<p>I use <code>pulumi</code> CLI to run this program to provision the actual resource in AWS:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">&gt; pulumi up

Previewing update (urlshortener):

     Type                   Name             Plan
 +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack    urlshortener     create
 +    aws:dynamodb:Table    urls             create

Resources:
    + 2 to create

Do you want to perform this update? yes
Updating (urlshortener):

     Type                   Name             Status
 +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack    urlshortener     created
 +    aws:dynamodb:Table    urls             created

Resources:
    + 2 created</code></pre>
<p>The CLI first shows the preview of the changes to be made, and when I confirm, it creates the resource. It also creates a <em>stack</em>&mdash;a container for all the resources of the application.</p>
<p>This code might look like an imperative command to create a DynamoDB table, but it actually isn&#39;t. If I go ahead and change <code>readCapacity</code> to <code>2</code> and then re-run <code>pulumi up</code>, it produces a different outcome:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">&gt; pulumi up

Previewing update (urlshortener):

     Type                   Name             Plan
     pulumi:pulumi:Stack    urlshortener        
 ~   aws:dynamodb:Table     urls             update  [diff: ~readCapacity]

Resources:
    ~ 1 to update
    1 unchanged</code></pre>
<p>It detects the exact change that I made and suggests an update. The following picture illustrates how Pulumi works:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/02/from-yaml-to-typescript-developers-view-on-cloud-automation/how-pulumi-works.png" alt="How Pulumi works"></p>
<figcaption>How Pulumi works</figcaption>

<p><code>index.ts</code> in the red square is my program. Pulumi&#39;s language host understands TypeScript and translates the code to commands to the internal engine. As a result, the engine builds a tree of resources-to-be-provisioned, the desired state of the infrastructure.</p>
<p>The end state of the last deployment is persisted in the storage (can be in pulumi.com backend or a file on disk). The engine then compares the current state of the system with the desired state of the program and calculates the delta in terms of create-update-delete commands to the cloud provider.</p>
<h2 id="help-of-types">Help Of Types</h2>
<p>Now I can proceed to the code that defines a Lambda function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">// Create a Role giving our Lambda access.
let policy: aws.iam.PolicyDocument = { /* Redacted for brevity */ };
let role = new aws.iam.Role(&quot;lambda-role&quot;, {
    assumeRolePolicy: JSON.stringify(policy),
});
let fullAccess = new aws.iam.RolePolicyAttachment(&quot;lambda-access&quot;, {
    role: role,
    policyArn: aws.iam.AWSLambdaFullAccess,
});

// Create a Lambda function, using code from the `./app` folder.
let lambda = new aws.lambda.Function(&quot;lambda-get&quot;, {
    runtime: aws.lambda.NodeJS8d10Runtime,
    code: new pulumi.asset.AssetArchive({
        &quot;.&quot;: new pulumi.asset.FileArchive(&quot;./app&quot;),
    }),
    timeout: 300,
    handler: &quot;read.handler&quot;,
    role: role.arn,
    environment: { 
        variables: {
            &quot;COUNTER_TABLE&quot;: counterTable.name
        }
    },
}, { dependsOn: [fullAccess] });</code></pre>
<p>You can see that the complexity kicked in and the code size is growing. However, now I start to gain real benefits from using a typed programming language:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m using objects in the definitions of other object&#39;s parameters. If I misspell their name, I don&#39;t get a runtime failure but an immediate error message from the editor.</li>
<li>If I don&#39;t know which options I need to provide, I can go to the type definition and look it up (or use IntelliSense).</li>
<li>If I forget to specify a mandatory option, I get a clear error.</li>
<li>If the type of the input parameter doesn&#39;t match the type of the object I&#39;m passing, I get an error again.</li>
<li>I can use language features like <code>JSON.stringify</code> right inside my program. In fact, I can reference and use any NPM module.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the code for API Gateway <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/fosdem2019/blob/master/samples/1-raw/index.ts#L60-L118">here</a>. It looks too verbose, doesn&#39;t it? Moreover, I&#39;m only half-way through with only one Lambda function defined.</p>
<h2 id="reusable-components">Reusable Components</h2>
<p>We can do better than that. Here is the improved definition of the same Lambda function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">import { Lambda } from &quot;./lambda&quot;;

const func = new Lambda(&quot;lambda-get&quot;, {
    path: &quot;./app&quot;,
    file: &quot;read&quot;,
    environment: { 
       &quot;COUNTER_TABLE&quot;: counterTable.name
    },
});</code></pre>
<p>Now, isn&#39;t that beautiful? Only the essential options remained, while all the machinery is gone. Well, it&#39;s not completely gone, it&#39;s been hidden behind an <em>abstraction</em>.</p>
<p>I defined a <strong>custom component</strong> called <code>Lambda</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">export interface LambdaOptions {
    readonly path: string;
    readonly file: string;

    readonly environment?:  pulumi.Input&lt;{
        [key: string]: pulumi.Input&lt;string&gt;;
    }&gt;;    
}

export class Lambda extends pulumi.ComponentResource {
    public readonly lambda: aws.lambda.Function;

    constructor(name: string,
        options: LambdaOptions,
        opts?: pulumi.ResourceOptions) {

        super(&quot;my:Lambda&quot;, name, opts);

        const role = //... Role as defined in the last snippet
        const fullAccess = //... RolePolicyAttachment as defined in the last snippet

        this.lambda = new aws.lambda.Function(`${name}-func`, {
            runtime: aws.lambda.NodeJS8d10Runtime,
            code: new pulumi.asset.AssetArchive({
                &quot;.&quot;: new pulumi.asset.FileArchive(options.path),
            }),
            timeout: 300,
            handler: `${options.file}.handler`,
            role: role.arn,
            environment: {
                variables: options.environment
            }
        }, { dependsOn: [fullAccess], parent: this });
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The interface <code>LambdaOptions</code> defines options that are important for my abstraction. The class <code>Lambda</code> derives from <code>pulumi.ComponentResource</code> and creates all the child resources in its constructor. </p>
<p>A nice effect is that one can see the structure in <code>pulumi</code> preview:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">Previewing update (fosdem-component-urlshortener):

     Type                                Name                  Plan

 +     aws:dynamodb:Table                urls                  create</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Endpoint</code> component simplifies definition of API Gateway (see <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/fosdem2019/blob/master/samples/2-components/endpoint.ts">the source</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">const api = new Endpoint(&quot;urlapi&quot;, {
    path: &quot;/{proxy+}&quot;,
    lambda: func.lambda
});</code></pre>
<p>The component hides the complexity from the clients; if the abstraction was selected correctly, that is. The component class can be reused in multiple places, in several projects, across teams, etc.</p>
<h2 id="standard-component-library">Standard Component Library</h2>
<p>In fact, Pulumi team came up with lots of high-level components that build abstractions on top of raw resources. The components from <code>@pulumi/cloud-aws</code> package are particularly useful for serverless applications.</p>
<p>Here is the full URL shortener application with DynamoDB table, Lambdas, API Gateway, and S3-based static files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">import * as aws from &quot;@pulumi/cloud-aws&quot;;

// Create a table `urls`, with `name` as primary key.
let urlTable = new aws.Table(&quot;urls&quot;, &quot;name&quot;);

// Create a web server.
let endpoint = new aws.API(&quot;urlshortener&quot;);

// Serve all files in the www directory to the root.
endpoint.static(&quot;/&quot;, &quot;www&quot;);

// GET /url/{name} redirects to the target URL based on a short-name.
endpoint.get(&quot;/url/{name}&quot;, async (req, res) =&gt; {
    let name = req.params[&quot;name&quot;];
    let value = await urlTable.get({name});
    let url = value &amp;&amp; value.url;

    // If we found an entry, 301 redirect to it; else, 404.
    if (url) {
        res.setHeader(&quot;Location&quot;, url);
        res.status(301);
        res.end(&quot;&quot;);
    }
    else {
        res.status(404);
        res.end(&quot;&quot;);
    }
});

// POST /url registers a new URL with a given short-name.
endpoint.post(&quot;/url&quot;, async (req, res) =&gt; {
    let url = req.query[&quot;url&quot;];
    let name = req.query[&quot;name&quot;];
    await urlTable.insert({ name, url });
    res.json({ shortenedURLName: name });
});

export let endpointUrl = endpoint.publish().url;</code></pre>
<p>The coolest thing here is that the actual <em>implementation code</em> of AWS Lambdas is <a href="https://blog.pulumi.com/lambdas-as-lambdas-the-magic-of-simple-serverless-functions">intertwined</a> with the <em>definition of resources</em>. The code looks very similar to an Express application. AWS Lambdas are defined as TypeScript lambdas. All strongly typed and compile-time checked.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that at the moment such high-level components only exist in TypeScript. One could create their custom components in Python or Go, but there is no standard library available. Pulumi folks <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/2430">are actively trying to figure out a way to bridge this gap</a>.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-vendor-lock-in-">Avoiding Vendor Lock-in?</h2>
<p>If you look closely at the previous code block, you notice that only one line is AWS-specific: the <code>import</code> statement. The rest is just naming. </p>
<p>We can get rid of that one too: just change the import to <code>import * as cloud from &quot;@pulumi/cloud&quot;;</code> and replace <code>aws.</code> with <code>cloud.</code> everywhere. Now, we&#39;d have to go to the stack configuration file and specify the cloud provider there:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">config:
  cloud:provider: aws</code></pre>
<p>Which is enough to make the application work again!</p>
<p>Vendor lock-in seems to be a big concern among many people when it comes to cloud architectures heavily relying on managed cloud services, including serverless applications. While I don&#39;t necessarily share those concerns and am not sure if generic abstractions are the right way to go, Pulumi Cloud library can be one direction for the exploration.</p>
<p>The following picture illustrates the choice of the level of abstraction that Pulumi provides:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/02/from-yaml-to-typescript-developers-view-on-cloud-automation/pulumi-layers.png" alt="Pulumi abstraction layers"></p>
<figcaption>Pulumi abstraction layers</figcaption>

<p>Working on top of the cloud provider&#39;s API and internal resource provider, you can choose to work with raw components with maximum flexibility, or opt-in for higher-level abstractions. Mix-and-match in the same program is possible too.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure-as-real-code">Infrastructure as Real Code</h2>
<p>Designing applications for the modern cloud means utilizing multiple cloud services which have to be configured to play nicely together. The Infrastructure as Code approach is almost a requirement to keep the management of such applications reliable in a team setting and over the extended period.</p>
<p>Application code and supporting infrastructure become more and more blended, so it&#39;s natural that software developers take the responsibility to define both. The next logical step is to use the same set of languages, tooling, and practices for both software and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Pulumi exposes cloud resources as APIs in several popular general-purpose programming languages. Developers can directly transfer their skills and experience to define, build, compose, and deploy modern cloud-native and serverless applications more efficiently than ever.</p>

        <title>Serverless at Scale: Serving StackOverflow-like Traffic</title>
        <link href="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/"/>
        <updated>2019-01-21T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <id>tag:mikhail.io,2019-01-21,/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Serverless compute is a very productive and quick way to get an application up and running. A developer writes a piece of code that solves a particular task and uploads it to the cloud. The provider handles code deployment and the ops burden of managing all the required infrastructure, so that the Function is always available, secure and performant.</p>
<p>Performance is a feature, and the ability to run the same application for 10 users or 10 million users is very appealing. Unfortunately, FaaS is not magical, so scalability limits do exist. That&#39;s why I spend time testing the existing FaaS services to highlight the cases where performance might not be perfect. For some background, you can read my previous articles:  <a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing/">From 0 to 1000 Instances: How Serverless Providers Scale Queue Processing</a> for queue-based workloads and <a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war/">Serverless: Cold Start War</a> for exploring cold start latencies.</p>
<p>Today, I want to dig into the scalability of serverless HTTP-based functions. HTTP-based functions are a popular use case that most developers can relate to, and they are also heavily impacted by the ability to scale. When your app goes viral on social networks, scores the Hacker News front page, or gets featured on TV, the last thing you want is slow responses and timeouts.</p>
<p>I implemented a simple HTTP-triggered function and deployed it across the Big-3 cloud providers&mdash;Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Next, I ran a load test issuing hundreds of requests per second to each function. In this article, I present the design and the results of these experiments.</p>
<p><em>DISCLAIMER: Performance testing is hard. I might be missing some crucial factors and parameters that influence the outcome. My interpretation might be wrong. The results might change over time. If you happen to know a way to improve my tests, please let me know, and I will re-run them and re-publish the results.</em></p>
<h2 id="stackoverflow-on-faas">StackOverflow on FaaS</h2>
<p>Every developer knows <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> and uses it pretty much every day. I&#39;ve made the goal to serve traffic comparable to what StackOverflow sees, solely from a serverless function.</p>
<p>StackOverflow is an excellent target for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish the actual request statistics from the site (see <a href="https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/">the data from 2016</a>)</li>
<li>Very transparent about their tech stack (same link above)</li>
<li>Publish  <a href="https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2015/10/how-to-download-the-stack-overflow-database-via-bittorrent/">the full database</a> and provide <a href="https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/queries">a tool to query the data online</a></li>
</ul>
<p>StackOverflow runs on .NET Core, SQL Server, Redis, Elastic, etc. Obviously, my goal is not to replicate the whole site. I just want to serve the comparable traffic to the outside world.</p>
<p>Here are some important metrics for my experiment:</p>
<ul>
<li>StackOverflow served 66 million pages per day, which is 760 pages/sec on average.</li>
<li>We’ll make the assumption that the vast majority of those pageviews are question pages, so I will ignore everything else.</li>
<li>We know they serve the whole page as one server-rendered HTML, so we’ll do something comparable.</li>
<li>Each page should be ~ 100kb size before compression.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, I came up with the following experiment design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a HTML template for the whole question page with question and answer markup replaced by placeholders.</li>
<li>Download the data of about 1000 questions and their respective answers from the <a href="https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new">the data explorer</a>.</li>
<li>Save the HTML templates and JSON data in blob storage of each cloud provider.</li>
<li>Implement a serverless function that retrieves the question data, populates the template, and returns the HTML in response.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/stackoverflow-test-setup.png" alt="Serving StackOverflow Traffic from a Serverless Function"></p>
<figcaption>Serving StackOverflow Traffic from a Serverless Function</figcaption>

<p>The HTML template is loaded at the first request and then cached in memory. The question/answers data file is loaded from the blob storage for every request. Template population is accomplished with string concatenation.</p>
<p>In my view, this setup is a simple but fair approximation of StackOverflow’s front-end. In addition, it is somewhat representative of many real-world web applications.</p>
<h2 id="metrics-setup">Metrics Setup</h2>
<p>I analyzed the scalability of the following cloud services:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Lambda triggered via Amazon API Gateway (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/lambda/latest/dg/with-on-demand-https.html">docs</a>)</li>
<li>Azure Function with an HTTP trigger (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook">docs</a>)</li>
<li>Google Cloud HTTP Function (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/writing/http">docs</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>All functions were implemented in JavaScript (Node.js) and were running on the latest GA runtime.</p>
<p>Since built-in monitoring tools, such as CloudWatch, would only report the function execution duration, which does not include other potential delays in the HTTP pipeline, I instead measured end-to-end latency from the client perspective. This means that the latency of the network and HTTP gateway (e.g., API Gateway in the case of AWS) were included in the total duration.</p>
<p>Requests were sent from multiple VMs outside the target cloud provider&#39;s region but in geographical proximity. Network latency was present in the metrics, but I estimated it to be 20-30 milliseconds at most.</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/measuring-response-time.png" alt="Measuring Response Time of a Serverless Function"></p>
<figcaption>Measuring Response Time of a Serverless Function</figcaption>

<p>Blob storage services of all cloud providers have enough throughput to serve one blob per HTTP request. However, the latencies differ among the clouds, so I included blob fetch duration measurements in the performance baseline.</p>
<p>Each measurement was then saved to persistent storage and analyzed afterward.</p>
<p>The charts below show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile">percentile</a> values. For instance, the 95th percentile (written as P95) value of 100ms means that 95% of the requests were faster than 100ms while 5% were slower than that. P50 is the median.</p>
<h2 id="load-pattern">Load Pattern</h2>
<p>I wanted to test the ability of serverless functions to scale up rapidly in response to the growth in request rate, so I came up with a dynamic load scenario.</p>
<p>The experiments started with a baseline 10% of the target load. The goal of the baseline was to make sure that the app was overall healthy, to evaluate the basic latency and the impact of blob storage on it.</p>
<p>At some point (around minute 0 of the charts), the load began to grow and reached 1000 RPS within 8 minutes. After the peak, the cooldown period started, and the load steadily decreased to zero in 8 more minutes.</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/request-distribution.png" alt="Request Distribution during the Load Test"></p>
<figcaption>Request Distribution during the Load Test</figcaption>

<p>Even though the growth period on the left and the decline period on the right represented the same number of requests, the hypothesis was that the first half might be more challenging because of the need to provision new resources rapidly.</p>
<p>In total, 600,000 requests were served within 17 minutes with the total outbound traffic of 70 GB.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve made it through all the mechanics, and now it&#39;s time to present the actual results.</p>
<h2 id="aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</h2>
<p>AWS Lambda was our first target for the experiment. I provisioned 512 MB size for Lambda instances, which is a medium-range value. I expected larger instances to be slightly faster, and smaller instances to be a bit slower, but the load is not very demanding to CPU, so the overall results should be comparable across the spectrum.</p>
<p>During the low-load baseline, the median response time was about 70 ms with a minimum of 50 ms. The median response time from the S3 bucket was 50 ms.</p>
<p>Here is the P50-P95 latency chart during the load test:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/aws-lambda-p50-p95.png" alt="AWS Lambda Response Time Distribution (P50-P95)"></p>
<figcaption>AWS Lambda Response Time Distribution (P50-P95)</figcaption>

<p>The percentiles were very consistent and flat. The median response time was still around 70 ms with no variance observed. P90 and P95 were quite stable too.</p>
<p>Only the 99th percentile displayed the difference between the ramp-up period on the left and the cooldown period on the right:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/aws-lambda-p99.png" alt="AWS Lambda Response Time Distribution (P99)"></p>
<figcaption>AWS Lambda Response Time Distribution (P99)</figcaption>

<p>AWS Lambda scales by creating multiple instances of the same function that handle the requests in parallel. Each Lambda instance is handling a single request at any given time, which is why the scale is measured in &quot;concurrent executions.&quot; When the current request is done being processed, the same instance can be reused for a subsequent request.</p>
<p>Instance identifier can be retrieved from <code>/proc/self/cgroup</code> of a lambda, so I recorded this value for each execution. The following chart shows the number of instances throughout the experiment:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/aws-lambda-concurrent-executions.png" alt="AWS Lambda Concurrent Executions"></p>
<figcaption>AWS Lambda Concurrent Executions</figcaption>There were about 80 concurrent executions at peak. That&#39;s quite a few, but still, almost an order of magnitude fewer instances compared to <a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing/#crunching-numbers">my queue processing experiment</a>. It felt that AWS was capable of scaling even further.<p></p>
<p>P99.9 showed slowness of the least lucky 0.1% requests. Most probably, it had lots of cold starts in it:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/aws-lambda-p999.png" alt="AWS Lambda Response Time Distribution (P99.9)"></p>
<figcaption>AWS Lambda Response Time Distribution (P99.9)</figcaption>Still, even those requests were mostly served within 2-3 seconds.<p></p>
<h2 id="google-cloud-functions">Google Cloud Functions</h2>
<p>Now, let&#39;s look at the results of Google Cloud Functions. Once again I provisioned 512 MB instance size (same as for Lambda).</p>
<p>During the low-load baseline, the median response time was about 150 ms with a minimum of 100 ms. Almost all of that time was spent fetching blobs from Cloud Storage: Its median latency was over 130 ms! I haven&#39;t spent too much time investigating the reason, but I assume that Google Cloud Storage has higher latency for small files than S3. Zach Bjornson published  <a href="http://blog.zachbjornson.com/2015/12/29/cloud-storage-performance.html">the comparison of storage latencies</a>. Although it&#39;s 3 years old, the conclusion was that &quot;GCS averaged more than three times higher latency&quot; when compared to Azure and AWS.</p>
<p>That&#39;s an important observation because the Function execution times were twice as big as those recorded on AWS. Keeping this difference in mind, here is the P50-P95 latency chart during the GCP load test:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/google-cloud-function-p50-p95.png" alt="Google Cloud Function Response Time Distribution (P50-P95)"></p>
<figcaption>Google Cloud Function Response Time Distribution (P50-P95)</figcaption>The median value was stable and flat at 150-180 ms. P90 and P95 had some spikes during the first 3 minutes. Google passed the test, but the lower percentiles were not perfect.<p></p>
<p>The 99th percentile was relatively solid though. It was higher on the left, but it stayed within 1 second most of the time:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/google-cloud-function-p99.png" alt="Google Cloud Function Response Time Distribution (P99)"></p>
<figcaption>Google Cloud Function Response Time Distribution (P99)</figcaption>The scaling model of Google Functions appeared to be very similar to the one of AWS Lambda. This means that 2x duration of the average execution required 2x more concurrent executions to run and 2x more instances to be provisioned:<p></p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/google-cloud-function-instances.png" alt="Google Cloud Function Concurrent Executions"></p>
<figcaption>Google Cloud Function Concurrent Executions</figcaption>Indeed, there were about 160 concurrent executions at peak. GCP had to work twice as hard because of the storage latency, which might explain some of the additional variations of response time.<p></p>
<p>Besides, Google seems to manage instance lifecycle differently. It provisioned a larger batch of instances during the first two minutes, which was in line with <a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing/#pause-the-world-workload">my previous findings</a>. It also kept instances for longer when the traffic went down (or at least, reused the existing instances more evenly).</p>
<p>For completeness, here are the P99.9 values:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/google-cloud-function-p999.png" alt="Google Cloud Function Response Time Distribution (P99.9)"></p>
<figcaption>Google Cloud Function Response Time Distribution (P99.9)</figcaption>They fluctuated between 1 and 5 seconds on the left and were incredibly stable on the right.<p></p>
<h2 id="azure">Azure</h2>
<p>Experiments with Azure Functions were run on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale#consumption-plan">Consumption Plan</a>
&mdash;the dynamically scaled and billed-per-execution runtime. Consumption Plan doesn&#39;t have a configuration for allocated memory or any other instance size parameters.</p>
<p>During the low-load baseline, the median response time was about 95 ms with a minimum of 45 ms, which is close to AWS and considerably faster than GCP. This time, JSON file retrieval was not the main contributor to the end-to-end latency: The median response time of Azure Blob Storage was an amazing 8 ms.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that the scaling model of Azure Functions doesn&#39;t work well for my experiment. Very high latencies were observed during the load test on Azure:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/azure-function-js-p50-p95.png" alt="Azure Function (Node.js) Response Time Distribution (P50-P95)"></p>
<figcaption>Azure Function (Node.js) Response Time Distribution (P50-P95)</figcaption>The concurrency model of Azure Functions is different from the counterparts of AWS/GCP. Function App instance is closer to a VM than a single-task container. It runs multiple concurrent executions in parallel. A central coordinator called Scale Controller monitors the metrics from existing instances and determines how many instances to provision on top. Instance identifier can be retrieved from environment variables of a function, so I recorded this value for each execution.<p></p>
<p>The multiple-requests-at-one-instance model didn&#39;t help in terms of the total instances required to process the traffic:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/azure-function-js-instances.png" alt="Azure Function (Node.js) Instances"></p>
<figcaption>Azure Function (Node.js) Instances</figcaption>At peak, 90 instances were required, which is almost the same as the number of current executions of AWS Lambda. Given the I/O bound nature of my function, this was surprising to me.<p></p>
<p>Puzzled by the moderate results, I decided to run the same application as a .NET Azure Function and compare the performance. The same function ported to C# got much faster:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/azure-function-dotnet-p50-p95.png" alt="Azure Function (.NET) Response Time Distribution (P50-P95)"></p>
<figcaption>Azure Function (.NET) Response Time Distribution (P50-P95)</figcaption>P50 was extremely good: It stayed below 50 ms (leveraging the blazingly fast Blob Storage) for the whole period except for one point when it was 140 ms. P90 and P95 were stable except for three data points.<p></p>
<p>The chart of instance growth was very different from the JavaScript one too:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2019/serverless-at-scale-serving-stackoverflow-like-traffic/azure-function-dotnet-instances.png" alt="Azure Function (.NET) Instances"></p>
<figcaption>Azure Function (.NET) Instances</figcaption>Basically, it spiked to 20 instances at the third minute, and that was enough for the rest of the test. I concluded that the .NET worker was more efficient compared to Node.js worker, at least for my scenario.<p></p>
<p>If I compare the percentile charts with the instance charts, it looks as if the latency spikes happen at the time when new instances get provisioned. For some reason, the performance suffers during the scale out. It&#39;s not just cold starts at the new instances: P90 and even P50 are affected. It might be a good topic for a separate investigation.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>During the experiment, sample StackOverflow pages were built and served from AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions at the rate of up to 1000 pageviews per second. Each Function call served a single pageview and was a combination of I/O workload (reading blob storage) and CPU usage (for parsing JSON and rendering HTML).</p>
<p>All cloud providers were able to scale up and serve the traffic. However, the latency distributions were quite different.</p>
<p>AWS Lambda was solid: Median response time was always below 100 ms, 95th percentile was below 200 ms, and 99th percentile exceeded 500 ms just once.</p>
<p>Google Cloud Storage seemed to have the highest latency out of the three cloud providers. Google Cloud Functions had a bit of a slowdown during the first two minutes of the scale-out but otherwise were quite stable and responsive.</p>
<p>Azure Functions had difficulties during the scale-out period and the response time went up to several seconds. .NET worker appeared to be more performant compared to Node.js one, but both of them show undesirable spikes when new instances are provisioned.</p>
<p>Here is my practical advice to take home:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function-as-a-Service is a great model to build applications that can work for low-usage scenarios, high-load applications, and even spiky workloads.</li>
<li>Scalability limits do exist, so if you anticipate high growth in the application&#39;s usage, run a simple load test to see how it behaves.</li>
<li>Always test in combination with your non-serverless dependencies. I&#39;ve selected scalable-by-definition cloud blob storage, and yet I got some influence of its behavior on the results. If you use a database or a third-party service, it&#39;s quite likely they will hit the scalability limit much earlier than the serverless compute.</li>
</ul>

        <title>A Fairy Tale of F# and Durable Functions</title>

        <updated>2018-12-20T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <id>tag:mikhail.io,2018-12-20,/2018/12/fairy-tale-of-fsharp-and-durable-functions/</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The post is a part of 
<a href="https://sergeytihon.com/2018/10/22/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2018/">F# Advent Calendar 2018</a>.
It&#39;s Christmas time!</em></p>
<p>This summer I was hired by the office of Santa Claus. Santa is not just a fairy tale
character on his own&mdash;he leads a large organization that supplies gifts and happiness to millions of 
children around the globe. Like any large organization, Santa&#39;s office employs an impressive number of 
IT systems. </p>
<p>As part of its IT modernization
effort, North Pole HQ restructured the whole supply chain of Christmas gifts. Many legacy components were moved from
a self-managed data center at the North Pole&mdash;although the cooling is quite cheap there&mdash;to 
Azure cloud. Azure was an easy sell since Santa&#39;s techy elves use Office 365, SharePoint and
the .NET development stack.</p>
<p>One of the goals of the redesign was to leverage managed cloud services and serverless architecture
wherever possible. Santa has no spare elves to keep reinventing IT wheels.</p>
<h2 id="wish-fulfillment-service">Wish Fulfillment Service</h2>
<p>My assignment was to redesign the <strong>Wish Fulfillment</strong> service. The service receives
wish lists from clients (they call children &quot;clients&quot;):</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/fairy-tale-of-fsharp-and-durable-functions/wish-list.png" alt="Christmas Wish List"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Christmas Card with a Wish List &copy; my son Tim</center>

<p>Luckily, the list is already parsed by some other service, and also contains the metadata about
the kid&#39;s background (age, gender, and so on) and preferences.</p>
<p>For each item in the list, our service calls the <strong>Matching</strong> service, which uses machine learning,
Azure Cognitive services, and a bit of magic to determine the actual products (they call gifts &quot;products&quot;)
that best fit the client&#39;s expressed desire and profile. For instance, my son&#39;s wish for &quot;LEGO Draak&quot; matches
to &quot;LEGO NINJAGO Masters of Spinjitzu Firstbourne Red Dragon&quot;. You get the point.</p>
<p>There might be several matches for each desired item, and each result has an estimate of how
likely it is to fulfill the original request and make the child happy.</p>
<p>All the matching products are combined and sent over to the <strong>Gift Picking</strong> service. Gift Picking selects one
of the options based on its price, demand, confidence level, and the Naughty-or-Nice score of the client.</p>
<p>The last step of the workflow is to <strong>Reserve</strong> the selected gift in the warehouse and shipping system
called &quot;Santa&#39;s Archive of Products&quot;, also referred to as SAP.</p>
<p>Here is the whole flow in one picture:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/fairy-tale-of-fsharp-and-durable-functions/gift-fulfillment-service.png" alt="Gift Fulfillment Workflow"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Gift Fulfillment Workflow</center>

<p>How should we implement this service?</p>
<h2 id="original-design">Original Design</h2>
<p>The Wish Fulfillment service should run in the cloud and integrate with other services. It
should be able to process millions of requests in December and stay very cheap to run during the
rest of the year. We decided to leverage serverless architecture with 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview">Azure Functions</a> on the 
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/functions/">Consumption Plan</a>. Serverless
Functions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fully Managed</strong>: the cloud provider provisions resources, scales them based on the load, takes
care of uptime and reliability;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Event-Driven</strong>: for each serverless Function you have to define a specific trigger&mdash;the 
event type which causes it to run, be it an HTTP endpoint or a queue message;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Changed per Execution</strong>: it costs nothing to run the application if there is no usage,
and the cost of busy applications is proportional to the actual resource utilization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the diagram of the original design:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/fairy-tale-of-fsharp-and-durable-functions/azure-functions-diagram.png" alt="Workflow Design with Azure Functions and Storage Queues"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Workflow Design with Azure Functions and Storage Queues</center>

<p>We used Azure Storage Queues to keep the whole flow asynchronous and more resilient to failures
and load fluctuation.</p>
<p>This design would mostly work, but we found a couple of problems with it:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Functions were manually wired via storage queues and corresponding bindings. The workflow
was spread over infrastructure definition and thus was hard to grasp.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We had to pass all items of each wish list into a single invocation of Matching Function,
otherwise combining the matching results from multiple queue messages would be tricky. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Although not in scope for the initial release, there were plans to add manual elf 
intervention for poorly matched items. This feature would require a change in the flow design:
it&#39;s not trivial to fit long-running processes into the pipeline.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To improve on these points, we decided to try 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview">Durable Functions</a>&mdash;a library 
that brings workflow orchestration to Azure Functions. It introduces several tools to define stateful,
potentially long-running operations, and handles a lot of the mechanics of reliable communication 
and state management behind the scenes.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about what Durable Functions are and why they might be a good idea,
I invite you to read my article 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/">Making Sense of Azure Durable Functions</a>
(20 minutes read).</p>
<p>For the rest of this post, I will walk you through the implementation of the Wish Fulfillment workflow
with Azure Durable Functions.</p>
<h2 id="domain-model">Domain Model</h2>
<p>A good design starts with a decent domain model. Luckily, the project was built with F#&mdash;the language with
the richest domain modeling capabilities in the .NET ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="types">Types</h3>
<p>Our service is invoked with a wish list as the input parameter, so let&#39;s start with the type <code>WishList</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type WishList = 
{
    Kid: Customer
    Wishes: string list
}</code></pre>
<p>It contains information about the author of the list and recognized &quot;order&quot; items. <code>Customer</code> is a custom type;
for now, it&#39;s not important what&#39;s in it.</p>
<p>For each wish we want to produce a list of possible matches:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Match = 
{
    Product: Product
    Confidence: Probability
}</code></pre>
<p>The product is a specific gift option from Santa&#39;s catalog, and the confidence is a number 
from <code>0.0</code> to <code>1.0</code> of how strong the match is.</p>
<p>The end goal of our service is to produce a <code>Reservation</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Reservation = 
{
    Kid: Customer
    Product: Product
}</code></pre>
<p>It represents the exact product selection for the specific kid.</p>
<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
<p>The Wish Fulfillment service needs to perform three actions, which can be
modeled with three strongly-typed asynchronous functions.</p>
<p><em>Note: I use lowercase &quot;function&quot; for F# functions and capitalize &quot;Function&quot; for Azure Functions
throughout the article to minimize confusion.</em></p>
<p>The <strong>first action</strong> finds matches for each wish:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">// string -&gt; Async&lt;Match list&gt;
let findMatchingGift (wish: string) = async {
    // Call a custom machine learning model
    // The real implementation uses the Customer profile to adjust decisions by age, etc.
    // but we&#39;ll keep the model simple for now.
}</code></pre>
<p>The first line of all my function snippets shows the function type. In this case, it&#39;s a mapping 
from the text of the child&#39;s wish (<code>string</code>) to a list of matches (<code>Match list</code>).</p>
<p>The <strong>second action</strong> takes the <em>combined</em> list of all matches of all wishes and picks one. Its
real implementation is Santa&#39;s secret sauce, but my model just picks the one with the highest
confidence level:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">// Match list -&gt; Product
let pickGift (candidates: Match list) =
    candidates
    |&gt; List.sortByDescending (fun x -&gt; x.Confidence)
    |&gt; List.head
    |&gt; (fun x -&gt; x.Product)</code></pre>
<p>Given the picked <code>gift</code>, the reservation is merely <code>{ Kid = wishlist.Kid; Product = gift }</code>,
not worthy of a separate action.</p>
<p>The <strong>third action</strong> registers a reservation in the SAP system:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">// Reservation -&gt; Async&lt;unit&gt;
let reserve (reservation: Reservation) = async {
    // Call Santa&#39;s Archive of Products
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="workflow">Workflow</h3>
<p>The fulfillment service combines the three actions into one workflow:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">// WishList -&gt; Async&lt;Reservation&gt;
let workflow (wishlist: WishList) = async {

    // 1. Find matches for each wish 
    let! matches = 
        wishlist.Wishes
        |&gt; List.map findMatchingGift
        |&gt; Async.Parallel

    // 2. Pick one product from the combined list of matches
    let gift = pickGift (List.concat matches)

    // 3. Register and return the reservation
    let reservation = { Kid = wishlist.Kid; Product = gift }
    do! reserve reservation
    return reservation
}</code></pre>
<p>The workflow implementation is a nice and concise summary of the actual domain flow.</p>
<p>Note that the Matching service is called multiple times in parallel, and then
the results are easily combined by virtue of the <code>Async.Parallel</code> F# function.</p>
<p>So how do we translate the domain model to the actual implementation on top of
serverless Durable Functions?</p>
<h2 id="classic-durable-functions-api">Classic Durable Functions API</h2>
<p>C# was the first target language for Durable Functions; Javascript is now fully supported too.</p>
<p>F# wasn&#39;t initially declared as officially supported, but since F# runs on top of the same .NET runtime
as C#, it has always worked. I have a blog post about
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/02/azure-durable-functions-in-fsharp/">Azure Durable Functions in F#</a> and
have added <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension/tree/master/samples/fsharp">F# samples</a>
to the official repository.</p>
<p>Here are two examples from that old F# code of mine (they have nothing to do with our 
gift fulfillment domain):</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">// 1. Simple sequencing of activities
let Run([&lt;OrchestrationTrigger&gt;] context: DurableOrchestrationContext) = task {
  let! hello1 = context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(&quot;E1_SayHello&quot;, &quot;Tokyo&quot;)
  let! hello2 = context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(&quot;E1_SayHello&quot;, &quot;Seattle&quot;)
  let! hello3 = context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(&quot;E1_SayHello&quot;, &quot;London&quot;)
  return [hello1; hello2; hello3]
}     

// 2. Parallel calls snippet
let tasks = Array.map (fun f -&gt; context.CallActivityAsync&lt;int64&gt;(&quot;E2_CopyFileToBlob&quot;, f)) files
let! results = Task.WhenAll tasks</code></pre>
<p>This code works and does its job, but doesn&#39;t look like idiomatic F# code:</p>
<ul>
<li>No strong typing: Activity Functions are called by name and with types manually specified</li>
<li>Functions are not curried, so partial application is hard</li>
<li>The need to pass the <code>context</code> object around for any Durable operation</li>
</ul>
<p>Although not shown here, the other samples read input parameters, handle errors, and enforce
timeouts&mdash;all look too C#-y.</p>
<h2 id="better-durable-functions">Better Durable Functions</h2>
<p>Instead of following the sub-optimal route, we implemented the service with a more F#-idiomatic API.
I&#39;ll show the code first, and then I&#39;ll explain its foundation.</p>
<p>The implementation consists of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activity</strong> Functions&mdash;one per action from the domain model</li>
<li><strong>Orchestrator</strong> Function defines the workflow</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings">Azure Functions bindings</a></strong> 
to instruct how to run the application in the cloud</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="activity-functions">Activity Functions</h3>
<p>Each Activity Function defines one step of the workflow: Matching, Picking, and Reserving. We
simply reference the F# functions of those actions in one-line definitions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let findMatchingGiftActivity = Activity.defineAsync &quot;FindMatchingGift&quot; findMatchingGift
let pickGiftActivity = Activity.define &quot;PickGift&quot; pickGift
let reserveActivity = Activity.defineAsync &quot;Reserve&quot; reserve</code></pre>
<p>Each activity is defined by a name and a function.</p>
<h3 id="orchestrator">Orchestrator</h3>
<p>The Orchestrator calls Activity Functions to produce the desired outcome of the service. The code
uses a custom computation expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let workflow wishlist = orchestrator {
    let! matches = 
        wishlist.Wishes
        |&gt; List.map (Activity.call findMatchingGiftActivity)
        |&gt; Activity.all

    let! gift = Activity.call pickGiftActivity (List.concat matches)

    let reservation = { Kid = wishlist.Kid; Product = gift }
    do! Activity.call reserveActivity reservation
    return reservation
}</code></pre>
<p>Notice how closely it matches the workflow definition from our domain model:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/fairy-tale-of-fsharp-and-durable-functions/durable-orchestrator-vs-async.png" alt="Async Function vs. Durable Orchestrator"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Async function vs. Durable Orchestrator</center>

<p>The only differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>orchestrator</code> computation expression is used instead of <code>async</code> because multi-threading is
not allowed in Orchestrators</li>
<li><code>Activity.call</code> replaces of direct invocations of functions</li>
<li><code>Activity.all</code> substitutes <code>Async.Parallel</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hosting-layer">Hosting layer</h3>
<p>An Azure Function trigger needs to be defined to host any piece of code as a cloud Function. This can
be done manually in <code>function.json</code>, or via trigger generation from .NET attributes. In my case
I added the following four definitions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">[&lt;FunctionName(&quot;FindMatchingGift&quot;)&gt;]
let FindMatchingGift([&lt;ActivityTrigger&gt;] wish) = 
    Activity.run findMatchingGiftActivity wish

[&lt;FunctionName(&quot;PickGift&quot;)&gt;]
let PickGift([&lt;ActivityTrigger&gt;] matches) = 
    Activity.run pickGiftActivity matches

[&lt;FunctionName(&quot;Reserve&quot;)&gt;]
let Reserve([&lt;ActivityTrigger&gt;] wish) = 
    Activity.run reserveActivity wish

[&lt;FunctionName(&quot;WishlistFulfillment&quot;)&gt;]
let Workflow ([&lt;OrchestrationTrigger&gt;] context: DurableOrchestrationContext) =
    Orchestrator.run (workflow, context)</code></pre>
<p>The definitions are very mechanical and, again, strongly typed (apart from Functions&#39; names).</p>
<h3 id="ship-it-">Ship It!</h3>
<p>These are all the bits required to get our Durable Wish Fulfillment service up and running.
From this point, we can leverage all the existing tooling of Azure Functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code for development and debugging</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools">Azure Functions Core Tools</a> to run
the application locally and deploy it to Azure</li>
<li>The latest version of the Core Tools has dedicated commands to 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-instance-management">manage instances of Durable Functions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a learning curve in the process of adopting the serverless architecture. However, a small
project like ours is a great way to do the learning. It sets Santa&#39;s IT department on the road
to success, and children will get better gifts more reliably!</p>
<h2 id="durablefunctions-fsharp">DurableFunctions.FSharp</h2>
<p>The above code was implemented with the library 
<a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/DurableFunctions.FSharp">DurableFunctions.FSharp</a>. I created
this library as a thin F#-friendly wrapper around Durable Functions.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, the whole purpose of this article is to introduce the library and make you curious
enough to give it a try. DurableFunctions.FSharp has several pieces in the toolbox:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>OrchestratorBuilder</code> and <code>orchestrator</code> computation expression which encapsulates proper 
usage of <code>Task</code>-based API of <code>DurableOrchestrationContext</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Activity</code> generic type to define activities as first-class values</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Activity</code> module with helper functions to call activities</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adapters for Azure Functions definition for <code>Async</code> and <code>Orchestrator</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>API of the original Durable Extensions is still available, so you can fall back to them if needed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, F# is a great language to develop serverless Functions. The simplicity of working with functions,
immutability by default, strong type system, focus on data pipelines are all useful in the world of
event-driven cloud applications.</p>
<p>Azure Durable Functions brings higher-level abstractions to compose workflows out of simple building
blocks. The goal of DurableFunctions.FSharp is to make such composition natural and enjoyable for F#
developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/DurableFunctions.FSharp#getting-started">Getting Started</a> 
is as easy as creating a new .NET Core project and referencing a NuGet package. </p>
<p>I&#39;d love to get as much feedback as possible! Leave comments below, create issues
on the <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/DurableFunctions.FSharp">GitHub repository</a>, or open a PR. 
This would be super awesome!</p>
<p>Happy coding, and Merry Christmas!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Stateful Workflows on top of Stateless Serverless Cloud Functions&mdash;this is the essence
of the Azure Durable Functions library. That&#39;s a lot of fancy words in one sentence, and they
might be hard for the majority of readers to understand.</p>
<p>Please join me on the journey where I&#39;ll try to explain how those buzzwords fit
together. I will do this in 3 steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the context of modern cloud applications relying on serverless architecture;</li>
<li>Identify the limitations of basic approaches to composing applications out of the simple building blocks;</li>
<li>Explain the solutions that Durable Functions offer for those problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="microservices">Microservices</h2>
<p>Traditionally, server-side applications were built in a style which is now referred to as
<strong>Monolith</strong>. If multiple people and teams were developing parts of the same application, they
mostly contributed to the same code base. If the code base were structured well, it would have
some distinct modules or components, and a single team would typically own each module:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/monolith.png" alt="Monolith"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Multiple components of a monolithic application</center>

<p>Usually, the modules would be packaged together at build time and then deployed as a single
unit, so a lot of communication between modules would stay inside the OS process.</p>
<p>Although the modules could stay loosely coupled over time, the coupling almost always occurred
on the level of the data store because all teams would use a single centralized database.</p>
<p>This model works great for small- to medium-size applications, but it turns out that teams
start getting in each other&#39;s way as the application grows since synchronization of contributions
takes more and more effort.</p>
<p>As a complex but viable alternative, the industry came up with a revised service-oriented
approach commonly called <strong>Microservices</strong>. The teams split the big application into &quot;vertical slices&quot; 
structured around the distinct business capabilities:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/microservices.png" alt="Microservices"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Multiple components of a microservice-based application</center>

<p>Each team then owns a whole vertical&mdash;from public communication contracts, or even UIs, down
to the data storage. Explicitly shared databases are strongly discouraged. Services talk to each
other via documented and versioned public contracts.</p>
<p>If the borders for the split were selected well&mdash;and that&#39;s the most tricky part&mdash;the
contracts stay stable over time, and thin enough to avoid too much chattiness. This gives
each team enough autonomy to innovate at their best pace and to make independent technical decisions.</p>
<p>One of the drawbacks of microservices is the change in deployment model. The services are now
deployed to separate servers connected via a network:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/distributed-system.png" alt="Distributed Systems"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Challenges of communication between distributed components</center>

<p>Networks are fundamentally unreliable: they work just fine most of the time, but when they 
fail, they fail in all kinds of unpredictable and least desirable manners. There are books
written on the topic of distributed systems architecture. TL;DR: it&#39;s hard.</p>
<p>A lot of the new adopters of microservices tend to ignore such complications. REST over HTTP(S) is the
dominant style of connecting microservices. Like any other synchronous communication
protocol, it makes the system brittle.</p>
<p>Consider what happens when one service becomes temporary unhealthy: maybe its database goes offline, or it&#39;s struggling to 
keep up with the request load, or a new version of the service is being deployed. All the requests to the problematic service start
failing&mdash;or worse&mdash;become very slow. The dependent service waits for the response, and
thus blocks all incoming requests of its own. The error propagates upstream very quickly causing cascading
failures all over the place:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/cascading-failures.png" alt="Cascading Failures"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Error in one component causes cascading failures</center>

<p>The application is down. Everybody screams and starts the blame war.</p>
<h2 id="event-driven-applications">Event-Driven Applications</h2>
<p>While cascading failures of HTTP communication can be mitigated with patterns like a circuit breaker
and graceful degradation, a better solution is to switch to the asynchronous style of communication
as the default. Some kind of persistent queueing service is used as an intermediary.</p>
<p>The style of application architecture which is based on sending events between services
is known as <strong>Event-Driven</strong>. When a service does something useful, it publishes an event&mdash;a record 
about the fact which happened to its business domain. Another service listens to the published events and 
executes its own duty in response to those facts:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/event-driven.png" alt="Event-Driven Application"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Communication in event-driven applications</center>

<p>The service that produces events might not know about the consumers. New event subscribers can
be introduced over time. This works better in theory than in practice, but the services tend to
get coupled less.</p>
<p>More importantly, if one service is down, other services don&#39;t catch fire immediately. The
upstream services keep publishing the events, which build up in the queue but can be stored safely
for hours or days. The downstream services might not be doing anything useful for this particular
flow, but it can stay healthy otherwise.</p>
<p>However, another potential issue comes hand-in-hand with loose coupling: low cohesion.
As Martin Fowler notices in his essay
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html">What do you mean by &quot;Event-Driven&quot;</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s very easy to make nicely decoupled systems with event notification, without realizing 
that you&#39;re losing sight of the larger-scale flow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given many components that publish and subscribe to a large number of event types, it&#39;s easy to stop
seeing the forest for the trees. Combinations of events usually constitute gradual workflows executed 
in time. A workflow is more than the sum of its parts, and understanding of the high-level flow is 
paramount to controlling the system behavior.</p>
<p>Hold this thought for a minute; we&#39;ll get back to it later. Now it&#39;s time to talk <em>cloud</em>.</p>
<h2 id="cloud">Cloud</h2>
<p>The birth of public cloud changed the way we architect applications. It made many things
much more straightforward: provisioning of new resources in minutes instead of months, scaling elastically
based on demand, and resiliency and disaster recovery at the global scale.</p>
<p>It made other things more complicated. Here is the picture of the global Azure network:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/azure-network.png" alt="Azure Network"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Azure locations with network connections</center>

<p>There are good reasons to deploy applications to more than one geographical location:
among others, to reduce network latency by staying close to the customer, and to achieve resilience through 
geographical redundancy. Public Cloud is the ultimate distributed system. As you remember,
distributed systems are hard.</p>
<p>There&#39;s more to that. Each cloud provider has dozens and dozens of managed services, which is
the curse and the blessing. Specialized services are great to provide off-the-shelf solutions 
to common complex problems. On the flip side, each service has distinct properties regarding 
consistency, resiliency and fault tolerance.</p>
<p>In my opinion, at this point developers have to embrace the public cloud and apply the distributed 
system design on top of it. If you agree, there is an excellent way to approach it.</p>
<h2 id="serverless">Serverless</h2>
<p>The slightly provocative term <strong>serverless</strong> is used to describe cloud services that do not
require provisioning of VMs, instances, workers, or any other fixed capacity to run
custom applications on top of them. Resources are allocated dynamically and transparently,
and the cost is based on their actual consumption, rather than on pre-purchased capacity.</p>
<p>Serverless is more about operational and economical properties of the system than about the
technology per se. Servers do exist, but they are someone else&#39;s concern. You don&#39;t manage
the uptime of serverless applications: the cloud provider does.</p>
<p>On top of that, you pay for what you use, similar to the consumption of other commodity resources
like electricity. Instead of buying a generator to power up your house, you just purchase energy
from the power company. You lose some control (e.g., no way to select the voltage), but this is fine
in most cases. The great benefit is no need to buy and maintain the hardware.</p>
<p>Serverless compute does the same: it supplies standard services on a pay-per-use basis.</p>
<p>If we talk more specifically about Function-as-a-Service offerings like Azure Functions, they
provide a standard model to run small pieces of code in the cloud.
You zip up the code or binaries and send it to Azure; Microsoft takes care of all the
hardware and software required to run it. The infrastructure automatically scales up or down based
on demand, and you pay per request, CPU time and memory that the application consumed. 
No usage&mdash;no bill.</p>
<p>However, there&#39;s always a &quot;but&quot;. FaaS services come with an opinionated development model that
applications have to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Event-Driven</strong>: for each serverless function you have to define a specific trigger&mdash;the 
event type which causes it to run, be it an HTTP endpoint or a queue message;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Lived</strong>: functions can only run up to several minutes, and preferably for a few seconds 
or less;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stateless</strong>: as you don&#39;t control where and when function instances are provisioned or
deprovisioned, there is no way to store data within the process between requests reliably;
external storage has to be utilized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Frankly speaking, the majority of existing applications don&#39;t really fit into this model.
If you are lucky to work on a new application (or a new module of it), you are in better shape.</p>
<p>A lot of the serverless applications may be designed to look somewhat similar to this example
from <a href="https://www.serverless360.com/blog/building-reactive-solution-with-azure-event-grid">the Serverless360 blog</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/serviceful-example.png" alt="Serviceful Serverless Application"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Sample application utilizing "serviceful" serverless architecture</center>

<p>There are 9 managed Azure services working together in this app. Most of them have a unique purpose, but
the services are all glued together with Azure Functions. An image is uploaded to Blob Storage, an
Azure Function calls Vision API to recognize the license plate and send the result to Event Grid, another 
Azure Function puts that event to Cosmos DB, and so on.</p>
<p>This style of cloud applications is sometimes referred to as <strong>Serviceful</strong> to emphasize the heavy usage
of managed services &quot;glued&quot; together by serverless functions.</p>
<p>Creating a comparable application without any managed services would be a much harder task,
even more so, if the application has to run at scale. Moreover, there&#39;s no way to keep the pay-as-you-go 
pricing model in the self-service world.</p>
<p>The application pictured above is still pretty straightforward. The processes
in enterprise applications are often much more sophisticated.</p>
<p>Remember the quote from Martin Fowler about losing sight of the large-scale flow. That was
true for microservices, but it&#39;s even more true for the &quot;nanoservices&quot; of cloud functions.</p>
<p>I want to dive deeper and give you several examples of related problems.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-of-serverless-composition">Challenges of Serverless Composition</h2>
<p>For the rest of the article, I&#39;ll define an imaginary business application for booking trips to software
conferences. In order to go to a conference, I need to buy tickets to the conference itself,
purchase the flights, and book a room at a hotel.</p>
<p>In this scenario, it makes sense to create three Azure Functions, each one responsible for one step
of the booking process. As we prefer message passing, each Function emits an event which
the next function can listen for:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/conference-booking.png" alt="Conference Booking Application"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Conference booking application</center>

<p>This approach works, however, problems do exist.</p>
<h3 id="flexible-sequencing">Flexible Sequencing</h3>
<p>As we need to execute the whole booking process in sequence, the Azure Functions are wired
one after another by configuring the output of one function to match with the event source of
the downstream function.</p>
<p>In the picture above, the functions&#39; sequence is hard-defined. If we were to swap the order of booking 
the flights and reserving the hotel, that would require a code change&mdash;at least of the 
input/output wiring definitions, but probably also the functions&#39; parameter types.</p>
<p>In this case, are the functions <em>really</em> decoupled?</p>
<h3 id="error-handling">Error Handling</h3>
<p>What happens if the Book Flight function becomes unhealthy, perhaps due to the
outage of the third-party flight-booking service? Well, that&#39;s why we use asynchronous messaging:
after the function execution fails, the message returns to the queue and is picked
up again by another execution.</p>
<p>However, such retries happen almost immediately for most event sources. This might not
be what we want: an exponential back-off policy could be a smarter idea. At this point,
the retry logic becomes <strong>stateful</strong>: the next attempt should &quot;know&quot; the history of previous attempts
to make a decision about retry timing.</p>
<p>There are more advanced error-handling patterns too. If executions failures are not
intermittent, we may decide to cancel the whole process and run compensating actions
against the already completed steps.</p>
<p>An example of this is a fallback action: if the flight is not possible (e.g., no routes for this
origin-destination combination), the flow could choose to book a train instead:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/fallback-on-error.png" alt="Fallback On Error"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Fallback after 3 consecutive failures</center>

<p>This scenario is not trivial to implement with stateless functions. We could wait until a
message goes to the dead-letter queue and then route it from there, but this is brittle and
not expressive enough.</p>
<h3 id="parallel-actions">Parallel Actions</h3>
<p>Sometimes the business process doesn&#39;t have to be sequential. In our reservation scenario,
there might be no difference whether we book a flight before a hotel or vice versa. It could
be desirable to run those actions in parallel.</p>
<p>Parallel execution of actions is easy with the pub-sub capabilities of an event bus: both functions
should subscribe to the same event and act on it independently.</p>
<p>The problem comes when we need to reconcile the outcomes of parallel actions, e.g., calculate the
final price for expense reporting purposes:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/fanout-fanin.png" alt="Fan-out / Fan-in"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Fan-out / fan-in pattern</center>

<p>There is no way to implement the Report Expenses block as a single Azure Function: functions
can&#39;t be triggered by two events, let alone correlate two <em>related</em> events.</p>
<p>The solution would probably include two functions, one per event, and the shared storage
between them to pass information about the first completed booking to the one who
completes last. All this wiring has to be implemented in custom code. The complexity grows
if more than two functions need to run in parallel.</p>
<p>Also, don&#39;t forget the edge cases. What if one of the function fails? How do you make sure there is
no race condition when writing and reading to/from the shared storage?</p>
<h3 id="missing-orchestrator">Missing Orchestrator</h3>
<p>All these examples give us a hint that we need an additional tool to organize low-level
single-purpose independent functions into high-level workflows.</p>
<p>Such a tool can be called an <strong>Orchestrator</strong> because its sole mission is to delegate work
to stateless actions while maintaining the big picture and history of the flow.</p>
<p>Azure Durable Functions aims to provide such a tool.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-azure-durable-functions">Introducing Azure Durable Functions</h2>
<h3 id="azure-functions">Azure Functions</h3>
<p>Azure Functions is the serverless compute service from Microsoft. Functions are event-driven:
each function defines a <strong>trigger</strong>&mdash;the exact definition of the event source, for instance,
the name of a storage queue.</p>
<p>Azure Functions can be programmed in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/supported-languages">several languages</a>. 
A basic Function with a
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-queue">Storage Queue trigger</a>
implemented in C# would look like this: </p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">[FunctionName(&quot;MyFirstFunction&quot;)]
public static void QueueTrigger(
    [QueueTrigger(&quot;myqueue-items&quot;)] string myQueueItem, 
    ILogger log)
{
    log.LogInformation($&quot;C# function processed: {myQueueItem}&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>FunctionName</code> attribute exposes the C# static method as an Azure Function named <code>MyFirstFunction</code>. 
The <code>QueueTrigger</code> attribute defines the name of the storage queue to listen to. The function body
logs the information about the incoming message.</p>
<h3 id="durable-functions">Durable Functions</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview">Durable Functions</a>
is a library that brings workflow orchestration abstractions to
Azure Functions. It introduces a number of idioms and tools to define stateful,
potentially long-running operations, and manages a lot of mechanics of reliable communication 
and state management behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The library records the history of all actions in Azure Storage services, enabling durability 
and resilience to failures.</p>
<p>Durable Functions is 
<a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension">open source</a>, 
Microsoft accepts external contributions, and the community is quite active.</p>
<p>Currently, you can write Durable Functions in 3 programming languages: C#, F#, and
Javascript (Node.js). All my examples are going to be in C#. For Javascript,
check <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/quickstart-js-vscode">this quickstart</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension/tree/master/samples/javascript">these samples</a>.
For F# see <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension/tree/master/samples/fsharp">the samples</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/DurableFunctions.FSharp">the F#-specific library</a> and my article 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/fairy-tale-of-fsharp-and-durable-functions/">A Fairy Tale of F# and Durable Functions</a>. </p>
<p>Workflow building functionality is achieved by the introduction of two additional types
of triggers: Activity Functions and Orchestrator Functions.</p>
<h3 id="activity-functions">Activity Functions</h3>
<p>Activity Functions are simple stateless single-purpose building blocks
that do just one task and have no awareness of the bigger workflow. 
A new trigger type,
<code>ActivityTrigger</code>, was introduced to expose functions as workflow steps, as
I explain below.</p>
<p>Here is a simple Activity Function implemented in C#:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">[FunctionName(&quot;BookConference&quot;)]
public static ConfTicket BookConference([ActivityTrigger] string conference)
{
    var ticket = BookingService.Book(conference);
    return new ConfTicket { Code = ticket };
}</code></pre>
<p>It has a common <code>FunctionName</code> attribute to expose the C# static method as an
Azure Function named <code>BookConference</code>. The name is important because it is used to
invoke the activity from orchestrators.</p>
<p>The <code>ActivityTrigger</code> attribute defines the trigger type and points to the input
parameter <code>conference</code> which the activity expects to get for each invocation.</p>
<p>The function can return a result of any serializable type; my sample function
returns a simple property bag called <code>ConfTicket</code>.</p>
<p>Activity Functions can do pretty much anything: call other services, load and
save data from/to databases, and use any .NET libraries.</p>
<h3 id="orchestrator-functions">Orchestrator Functions</h3>
<p>The Orchestrator Function is a unique concept introduced by Durable Functions. Its sole
purpose is to manage the flow of execution and data among several activity functions.</p>
<p>Its most basic form chains multiple independent activities into a single
sequential workflow.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with an example which books a conference ticket, a flight itinerary, and
a hotel room one-by-one:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/sequential-workflow.png" alt="Sequential Workflow"></p>
<center class="img-caption">3 steps of a workflow executed in sequence</center>

<p>The implementation of this workflow is defined by another C# Azure Function, this time with
<code>OrchestrationTrigger</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">[FunctionName(&quot;SequentialWorkflow&quot;)]
public static async Task Sequential([OrchestrationTrigger] DurableOrchestrationContext context)
{
    var conference = await context.CallActivityAsync&lt;ConfTicket&gt;(&quot;BookConference&quot;, &quot;ServerlessDays&quot;);
    var flight = await context.CallActivityAsync&lt;FlightTickets&gt;(&quot;BookFlight&quot;, conference.Dates);
    await context.CallActivityAsync(&quot;BookHotel&quot;, flight.Dates);
}</code></pre>
<p>Again, attributes are used to describe the function for the Azure runtime.</p>
<p>The only input parameter has type <code>DurableOrchestrationContext</code>. This context is the tool that
enables the orchestration operations.</p>
<p>In particular, the <code>CallActivityAsync</code> method is used three times to invoke three activities one after the other.
The method body looks very typical for any C# code working with a <code>Task</code>-based API. However,
the behavior is entirely different. Let&#39;s have a look at the implementation details.</p>
<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s walk through the lifecycle of one execution of the sequential workflow above.</p>
<p>When the orchestrator starts running, the first <code>CallActivityAsync</code> invocation is made to book the
conference ticket. What actually happens here is that a queue message is sent from the orchestrator
to the activity function. </p>
<p>The corresponding activity function gets triggered by the queue message. It does its job (books the 
ticket) and returns the result. The activity function serializes the result and sends it as a queue 
message back to the orchestrator:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/durable-messaging.png" alt="Durable Functions: Message Passing"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Messaging between the orchestrator and the activity</center>

<p>When the message arrives, the orchestrator gets triggered again and can proceed to the second
activity. The cycle repeats&mdash;a message gets sent to Book Flight activity, it gets triggered, does its
job, and sends a message back to the orchestrator.
The same message flow happens for the third call.</p>
<h3 id="stop-resume-behavior">Stop-resume behavior</h3>
<p>As discussed earlier, message passing is intended to decouple the sender and receiver in time.
For every message in the scenario above, no immediate response is expected. </p>
<p>On the C# level, when the <code>await</code> operator is executed, the code doesn&#39;t block the execution of the whole
orchestrator. Instead, it just quits: the orchestrator stops being active and its current step completes.</p>
<p>Whenever a return message arrives from an activity, the orchestrator code restarts. It always starts
with the first line. Yes, this means that the same line is executed multiple times: up to the number of
messages to the orchestrator.</p>
<p>However, the orchestrator stores the history of its past executions in Azure Storage, so the effect of the second pass
of the first line is different: instead of sending a message to the activity it already knows
the result of that activity, so <code>await</code> returns this result back and assigns it to the <code>conference</code> variable.</p>
<p>Because of these &quot;replays&quot;, the orchestrator&#39;s implementation has to be deterministic: don&#39;t use
<code>DateTime.Now</code>, random numbers or multi-thread operations; more details
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-checkpointing-and-replay#orchestrator-code-constraints">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="event-sourcing">Event Sourcing</h3>
<p>Azure Functions are stateless, while workflows require a state to keep track of their progress. Every time a new
action towards the workflow&#39;s execution happens, the framework automatically records an event in table storage.</p>
<p>Whenever an orchestrator restarts the execution because a new message arrives from its activity,
it loads the complete history of this particular execution from storage. Durable Context uses
this history to make decisions whether to call the activity or return the previously stored result.</p>
<p>The pattern of storing the complete history of state changes as an append-only event store is
known as Event Sourcing. Event store provides several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Durability</strong>&mdash;if a host running an orchestration fails, the history is retained in
persistent storage and is loaded by the new host where the orchestration restarts;</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>&mdash;append-only writes are fast and easy to spread over multiple storage servers;</li>
<li><strong>Observability</strong>&mdash;no history is ever lost, so it&#39;s straightforward to inspect and
analyze even after the workflow is complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an illustration of the notable events that get recorded during our sequential workflow:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/event-sourcing.png" alt="Durable Functions: Event Sourcing"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Log of events in the course of orchestrator progression</center>

<h3 id="billing">Billing</h3>
<p>Azure Functions on the serverless consumption-based plan are billed per execution + per duration of
execution.</p>
<p>The stop-replay behavior of durable orchestrators causes the single workflow &quot;instance&quot; to execute
the same orchestrator function multiple times. This also means paying for several short
executions.</p>
<p>However, the total bill usually ends up being much lower compared to the potential cost of blocking
synchronous calls to activities. The price of 5 executions of 100 ms each is significantly lower
than the cost of 1 execution of 30 seconds.</p>
<p>By the way, the first million executions per month are 
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/functions/">at no charge</a>,
so many scenarios incur no cost at all from Azure Functions service.</p>
<p>Another cost component to keep in mind is Azure Storage. Queues and Tables that are used behind the
scenes are charged to the end customer. In my experience, this charge remains close to zero for
low- to medium-load applications.</p>
<p>Beware of unintentional eternal loops or indefinite recursive fan-outs in your orchestrators. Those
can get expensive if you leave them out of control.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling-and-retries">Error-handling and retries</h2>
<p>What happens when an error occurs somewhere in the middle of the workflow? For instance, a third-party
flight booking service might not be able to process the request:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/error-handling.png" alt="Error Handling"></p>
<center class="img-caption">One activity is unhealthy</center>

<p>This situation is expected by Durable Functions. Instead of silently failing, the activity function
sends a message containing the information about the error back to the orchestrator.</p>
<p>The orchestrator deserializes the error details and, at the time of replay, throws a .NET exception
from the corresponding call. The developer is free to put a <code>try .. catch</code> block around the call
and handle the exception:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">[FunctionName(&quot;SequentialWorkflow&quot;)]
public static async Task Sequential([OrchestrationTrigger] DurableOrchestrationContext context)
{
    var conf = await context.CallActivityAsync&lt;ConfTicket&gt;(&quot;BookConference&quot;, &quot;ServerlessDays&quot;);
    try
    {
        var itinerary = MakeItinerary(/* ... */);
        await context.CallActivityAsync(&quot;BookFlight&quot;, itinerary);
    }
    catch (FunctionFailedException)
    {
        var alternativeItinerary = MakeAnotherItinerary(/* ... */);
        await context.CallActivityAsync(&quot;BookFlight&quot;, alternativeItinerary);
    }
    await context.CallActivityAsync(&quot;BookHotel&quot;, flight.Dates);
}</code></pre>
<p>The code above falls back to a &quot;backup plan&quot; of booking another itinerary. Another typical pattern
would be to run a compensating activity to cancel the effects of any previous actions (un-book the
conference in our case) and leave the system in a clean state.</p>
<p>Quite often, the error might be transient, so it might make sense to retry the failed operation
after a pause. It&#39;s a such a common scenario that Durable Functions provides a dedicated API:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var options = new RetryOptions(
    firstRetryInterval: TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1),                    
    maxNumberOfAttempts: 5);
options.BackoffCoefficient = 2.0;

await context.CallActivityWithRetryAsync(&quot;BookFlight&quot;, options, itinerary);</code></pre>
<p>The above code instructs the library to</p>
<ul>
<li>Retry up to 5 times</li>
<li>Wait for 1 minute before the first retry</li>
<li>Increase delays before every subsequent retry by the factor of 2 (1 min, 2 min, 4 min, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The significant point is that, once again, the orchestrator does not block while
awaiting retries. After a failed call, a message is scheduled for the moment in the future
to re-run the orchestrator and retry the call.</p>
<h2 id="sub-orchestrators">Sub-orchestrators</h2>
<p>Business processes may consist of numerous steps. To keep the code of orchestrators manageable,
Durable Functions allows nested orchestrators. A &quot;parent&quot; orchestrator can call out to child
orchestrators via the <code>context.CallSubOrchestratorAsync</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">[FunctionName(&quot;CombinedOrchestrator&quot;)]
public static async Task CombinedOrchestrator([OrchestrationTrigger] DurableOrchestrationContext context)
{
    await context.CallSubOrchestratorAsync(&quot;BookTrip&quot;, serverlessDaysAmsterdam);
    await context.CallSubOrchestratorAsync(&quot;BookTrip&quot;, serverlessDaysHamburg);
}</code></pre>
<p>The code above books two conferences, one after the other.</p>
<h2 id="fan-out-fan-in">Fan-out / Fan-in</h2>
<p>What if we want to run multiple activities in parallel?</p>
<p>For instance, in the example above, we could wish to book two conferences, but the
booking order might not matter. Still, when both bookings are completed, we want to combine the results
to produce an expense report for the finance department:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/12/making-sense-of-azure-durable-functions/parallel-calls.png" alt="Parallel Calls"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Parallel calls followed by a final step</center>

<p>In this scenario, the <code>BookTrip</code> orchestrator accepts an input parameter with the name of the 
conference and returns the expense information. <code>ReportExpenses</code> needs to receive both
expenses combined.</p>
<p>This goal can be easily achieved by scheduling two tasks (i.e., sending two messages) without
awaiting them separately. We use the familiar <code>Task.WhenAll</code> method to await both and combine
the results:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">[FunctionName(&quot;ParallelWorkflow&quot;)]
public static async Task Parallel([OrchestrationTrigger] DurableOrchestrationContext context)
{
    var amsterdam = context.CallSubOrchestratorAsync(&quot;BookTrip&quot;, serverlessDaysAmsterdam);
    var hamburg   = context.CallSubOrchestratorAsync(&quot;BookTrip&quot;, serverlessDaysHamburg);

    var expenses = await Task.WhenAll(amsterdam, hamburg);

    await context.CallActivityAsync(&quot;ReportExpenses&quot;, expenses);
}</code></pre>
<p>Remember that awaiting the <code>WhenAll</code> method doesn&#39;t synchronously block the orchestrator. It quits
the first time and then restarts two times on reply messages received from activities.
The first restart quits again, and only the second restart makes it past the <code>await</code>.</p>
<p><code>Task.WhenAll</code> returns an array of results (one result per each input task), which is then
passed to the reporting activity.</p>
<p>Another example of parallelization could be a workflow sending e-mails to hundreds of
recipients. Such fan-out wouldn&#39;t be hard with normal queue-triggered functions: simply send
hundreds of messages. However, combining the results, if required for the next step
of the workflow, is quite challenging.</p>
<p>It&#39;s straightforward with a durable orchestrator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var emailSendingTasks =
    recepients
    .Select(to =&gt; context.CallActivityAsync&lt;bool&gt;(&quot;SendEmail&quot;, to))
    .ToArray();

var results = await Task.WhenAll(emailSendingTasks);

if (results.All(r =&gt; r)) { /* ... */ }</code></pre>
<p>Making hundreds of roundtrips to activities and back could cause numerous replays
of the orchestrator. As an optimization, if multiple activity functions complete around the same 
time, the orchestrator may internally process several messages as a batch and restart 
the orchestrator function only once per batch.</p>
<h2 id="other-concepts">Other Concepts</h2>
<p>There are many more patterns enabled by Durable Functions. Here is a quick list to give you some perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Waiting for the <em>first</em> completed task in a collection (rather than <em>all</em> of them) using the <code>Task.WhenAny</code>
method. Useful for scenarios like timeouts or competing actions.</li>
<li>Pausing the workflow for a given period or until a deadline.</li>
<li>Waiting for external events, e.g., bringing human interaction into the workflow.</li>
<li>Running recurring workflows, when the flow repeats until a certain condition is met.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I firmly believe that serverless applications utilizing a broad range of managed cloud services
are highly beneficial to many companies, due to both rapid development process and
the properly aligned billing model.</p>
<p>Serverless tech is still young; more high-level architectural patterns need to emerge
to enable expressive and composable implementations of large business systems.</p>
<p>Azure Durable Functions suggests some of the possible answers. It combines the clarity and readability
of sequential RPC-style code with the power and resilience of event-driven architecture.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview">The documentation</a>
for Durable Functions is excellent, with plenty of examples and how-to guides.
Learn it, try it for your real-life scenarios, and let me know your opinion&mdash;I&#39;m
excited about the serverless future!</p>

        <title>From 0 to 1000 Instances: How Serverless Providers Scale Queue Processing</title>
        <link href="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing/"/>

        <id>tag:mikhail.io,2018-11-19,/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing/</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whenever I see a &quot;Getting Started with Function-as-a-Service&quot; tutorial, it usually shows off 
a synchronous HTTP-triggered scenario. In my projects, though, I use a lot of asynchronous 
functions triggered by a queue or an event stream.</p>
<p>Quite often, the number of messages passing through a queue isn&#39;t uniform over time. I might 
drop batches of work now and then. My app may get piles of queue items arriving from upstream 
systems that were down or under maintenance for an extended period. The system might see some 
rush-hour peaks every day or only a few busy days per month.</p>
<p>This is where serverless tech shines: You pay per execution, and then the promise is that the 
provider takes care of scaling up or down for you. Today, I want to put this scalability under 
test.</p>
<p>The goal of this article is to explore queue-triggered serverless functions and hopefully distill 
some practical advice regarding asynchronous functions for real projects. I will be evaluating 
the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Across Big-3 cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google)</li>
<li>For different types of workloads</li>
<li>For different performance tiers</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s see how I did that and what the outcome was.</p>
<p><em>DISCLAIMER. Performance testing is hard. I might be missing some crucial factors and parameters 
that influence the outcome. My interpretation might be wrong. The results might change over time. 
If you happen to know a way to improve my tests, please let me know, and I will re-run them and 
re-publish the results.</em></p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>In this article I analyze the execution results of the following cloud services:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Lambda triggered via SQS queues</li>
<li>Azure Function triggered via Storage queues</li>
<li>Google Cloud Function triggered via Cloud Pub/Sub</li>
</ul>
<p>All functions are implemented in Javascript and are running on GA runtime.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each test, I threw 100,000 messages into a queue that was previously idle. 
Enqueuing never took longer than one minute (I sent the messages from multiple clients in 
parallel).</p>
<p>I disabled any batch processing, so each message was consumed by a separate function invocation.</p>
<p>I then analyzed the logs (AWS CloudWatch, Azure Application Insights, and GCP Stackdriver 
Logging) to generate charts of execution distribution over time.</p>
<h2 id="how-scaling-actually-works">How Scaling Actually Works</h2>
<p>To understand the experiment better, let&#39;s look at a very simplistic but still useful model of 
how cloud providers scale serverless applications.</p>
<p>All providers handle the increased load by 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_and_vertical_scaling">scaling out</a>, i.e., 
by creating multiple instances of the same application that execute the chunks of work in 
parallel.</p>
<p>In theory, a cloud provider could spin up an instance for each message in the queue as soon as 
the messages arrive. The backlog processing time would then stay very close to zero.</p>
<p>In practice, allocating instances is not cheap. The Cloud provider has to boot up the function 
runtime, hit a <a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war/">cold start</a>, and waste 
expensive resources on a job that potentially will take just a few milliseconds.</p>
<p>So the providers are trying to find a sweet spot between handling the work as soon as possible 
and using resources efficiently. The outcomes differ, which is the point of my article.</p>
<h3 id="aws">AWS</h3>
<p>AWS Lambda defines scale out with a notion of Concurrent Executions. Each instance of your AWS 
Lambda is handling a single execution at any given time. In our case, it&#39;s processing a single 
SQS message.</p>
<p>It&#39;s helpful to think of a function instance as a container working on a single task. If execution 
pauses or waits for an external I/O operation, the instance is on hold.</p>
<p>The model of concurrent executions is universal to all trigger types supported by Lambdas. An 
instance doesn&#39;t work with event sources directly; it just receives an event to work on.</p>
<p>There is a central element in the system, let&#39;s call it &quot;Orchestrator&quot;. The Orchestrator is the 
component talking to an SQS queue and getting the messages from it. It&#39;s then the job of the 
Orchestrator and related infrastructure to provision the required number of instances for working 
on concurrent executions:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing//aws-lambda-queue-scaling.png" alt="Model of AWS Lambda Scale-Out"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Model of AWS Lambda Scale-Out</center>

<p>As to scaling behavior, here is what the official 
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/lambda/latest/dg/scaling.html">AWS docs</a> say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AWS Lambda automatically scales up ... until the number of concurrent function executions 
reaches 1000 ... Amazon Simple Queue Service supports an initial burst of 5 concurrent function 
invocations and increases concurrency by 60 concurrent invocations per minute.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="gcp">GCP</h3>
<p>The model of Google Cloud Functions is very similar to what AWS does. It runs a single 
simultaneous execution per instance and routes the messages centrally.</p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t able to find any scaling specifics except the definition of 
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/quotas">Function Quotas</a>.</p>
<h3 id="azure">Azure</h3>
<p>Experiments with Azure Functions were run on 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale#consumption-plan">Consumption Plan</a>
&mdash;the dynamically scaled and billed-per-execution runtime. The concurrency model of Azure Functions 
is different from the counterparts of AWS/GCP.</p>
<p>Function App instance is closer to a VM than a single-task container. It runs multiple concurrent 
executions in parallel. Equally importantly, it pulls messages from the queue on its own instead of 
getting them pushed from a central Orchestrator.</p>
<p>There is still a central coordinator called Scale Controller, but its role is a bit more subtle. It 
connects to the same data source (the queue) and needs to determine how many instances to provision 
based on the metrics from that queue:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing//azure-function-queue-scaling.png" alt="Model of Azure Function Scale-Out"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Model of Azure Function Scale-Out</center>

<p>This model has pros and cons. If one execution is idle, waiting for some I/O operation such as an 
HTTP request to finish, the instance might become busy processing other messages, thus being more 
efficient. Running multiple executions is useful in terms of shared resource utilization, e.g., 
keeping database connection pools and reusing HTTP connections.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the Scale Controller now needs to be smarter: to know not only the queue backlog 
but also how instances are doing and at what pace they are processing the messages. It&#39;s probably 
achievable based on queue telemetry though.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start applying this knowledge in practical experiments.</p>
<h2 id="pause-the-world-workload">Pause-the-World Workload</h2>
<p>My first serverless function is aimed to simulate I/O-bound workloads without using external 
dependencies to keep the experiment clean. Therefore, the implementation is extremely 
straightforward: pause for 500 ms and return.</p>
<p>It could be loading data from a scalable third-party API. It could be running a database query. 
Instead, it just runs <code>setTimeout</code>.</p>
<p>I sent 100k messages to queues of all three cloud providers and observed the result.</p>
<h3 id="aws">AWS</h3>
<p>AWS Lambda allows multiple instance sizes to be provisioned. Since the workload is neither CPU- 
nor memory-intensive, I was using the smallest memory allocation of 128 MB.</p>
<p>Here comes the first chart of many, so let&#39;s learn to read it. The horizontal axis shows time in 
minutes since all the messages were sent to the queue.</p>
<p>The line going from top-left to bottom-right shows the decreasing queue backlog. Accordingly, the 
left vertical axis denotes the number of items still-to-be-handled.</p>
<p>The bars show the number of concurrent executions crunching the messages at a given time. Every 
execution logs the instance ID so that I could derive the instance count from the logs. The right 
vertical axis shows the instance number.</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing//aws-lambda-sqs-iobound-scaling.png" alt="AWS Lambda processing 100k SQS messages with &quot;Pause&quot; handler"></p>
<center class="img-caption">AWS Lambda processing 100k SQS messages with "Pause" handler</center>

<p>It took AWS Lambda 5.5 minutes to process the whole batch of 100k messages. For comparison, the 
same batch processed sequentially would take about 14 hours.</p>
<p>Notice how linear the growth of instance count is. If I apply the official scaling formula:</p>
<pre><code>Instance Count = 5 + Minutes * 60 = 5 + 5.5 * 60  = 335</code></pre><p>We get a very close result! Promises kept.</p>
<h3 id="gcp">GCP</h3>
<p>Same function, same chart, same instance size of 128 MB of RAM&mdash;but this time for Google Cloud Functions:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing//gcp-cloud-function-pubsub-iobound-scaling.png" alt="Google Cloud Function processing 100k Pub/Sub messages with &quot;Pause&quot; handler"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Google Cloud Function processing 100k Pub/Sub messages with "Pause" handler</center>

<p>Coincidentally, the total amount of instances, in the end, was very close to AWS. The scaling
pattern looks entirely different though: Within the very first minute, there was a burst of 
scaling close to 300 instances, and then the growth got very modest.</p>
<p>Thanks to this initial jump, GCP managed to finish processing almost one minute earlier than AWS.</p>
<h3 id="azure">Azure</h3>
<p>Azure Function doesn&#39;t have a configuration for allocated memory or any other instance size parameters.</p>
<p>The shape of the chart for Azure Functions is very similar, but the instance number growth is 
significantly different:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing//azure-function-queue-iobound-scaling.png" alt="Azure Function processing 100k queue messages with &quot;Pause&quot; handler"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Azure Function processing 100k queue messages with "Pause" handler</center>

<p>The total processing time was a bit faster than AWS and somewhat slower than GCP. Azure Function 
instances process several messages in parallel, so it takes much less of them to do the same amount 
of work.</p>
<p>Instance number growth seems far more linear than bursty.</p>
<h3 id="what-we-learned">What we learned</h3>
<p>Based on this simple test, it&#39;s hard to say if one cloud provider handles scale-out better than 
the others.</p>
<p>It looks like all serverless platforms under stress are making decisions at the resolution of 5-15 
seconds, so the backlog processing delays are likely to be measured in minutes. It sounds quite far 
from the theoretical &quot;close to zero&quot; target but is most likely good enough for the majority of 
applications.</p>
<h2 id="crunching-numbers">Crunching Numbers</h2>
<p>That was an easy job though. Let&#39;s give cloud providers a hard time by executing CPU-heavy workloads 
and see if they survive!</p>
<p>This time, each message handler calculates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">Bcrypt</a>
hash with a cost of 10. One such calculation takes about 200 ms on my laptop.</p>
<h3 id="aws">AWS</h3>
<p>Once again, I sent 100k messages to an SQS queue and recorded the processing speed and instance count.</p>
<p>Since the workload is CPU-bound, and AWS allocates CPU shares proportionally to the allocated 
memory, the instance size might have a significant influence on the result.</p>
<p>I started with the smallest memory allocation of 128 MB:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing//aws-lambda-sqs-cpubound-scaling.png" alt="AWS Lambda (128 MB) processing 100k SQS messages with &quot;Bcrypt&quot; handler"></p>
<center class="img-caption">AWS Lambda (128 MB) processing 100k SQS messages with "Bcrypt" handler</center>

<p>This time it took almost 10 minutes to complete the experiment.</p>
<p>The scaling shape is pretty much the same as last time, still correctly described by the formula 
<code>60 * Minutes + 5</code>. However, because AWS allocates a small fraction of a full CPU to each 128 MB 
execution, one message takes around 1,700 ms to complete. Thus, the total work increased 
approximately by the factor of 3 (47 hours if done sequentially).</p>
<p>At the peak, 612 concurrent executions were running, nearly double the amount in our initial 
experiment. So, the total processing time increased only by the factor of 2&mdash;up to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see if larger Lambda instances would improve the outcome. Here is the chart for 512 MB of 
allocated memory:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing//aws-lambda-sqs-cpubound-scaling-512.png" alt="AWS Lambda (512 MB) processing 100k SQS messages with &quot;Bcrypt&quot; handler"></p>
<center class="img-caption">AWS Lambda (512 MB) processing 100k SQS messages with "Bcrypt" handler</center>

<p>And yes it does. The average execution duration is down to 400 ms: 4 times less, as expected. 
The scaling shape still holds, so the entire batch was done in less than four minutes.</p>
<h3 id="gcp">GCP</h3>
<p>I executed the same experiment on Google Cloud Functions. I started with 128 MB, and it looks 
impressive:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing//gcp-cloud-function-pubsub-cpubound-scaling.png" alt="Google Cloud Function (128 MB) processing 100k Pub/Sub messages with &quot;Bcrypt&quot; handler"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Google Cloud Function (128 MB) processing 100k Pub/Sub messages with "Bcrypt" handler</center>

<p>The average execution duration is very close to Amazon&#39;s: 1,600 ms. However, GCP scaled more 
aggressively&mdash;to a staggering 1,169 parallel executions! Scaling also has a different shape: 
It&#39;s not linear but grows in steep jumps. As a result, it took less than six minutes on the 
lowest CPU profile&mdash;very close to AWS&#39;s time on a 4x more powerful CPU.</p>
<p>What will GCP achieve on a faster CPU? Let&#39;s provision 512 MB. It must absolutely crush the 
test. Umm, wait, look at that:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing//gcp-cloud-function-pubsub-cpubound-scaling-512.png" alt="Google Cloud Function (512 MB) processing 100k Pub/Sub messages with &quot;Bcrypt&quot; handler"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Google Cloud Function (512 MB) processing 100k Pub/Sub messages with "Bcrypt" handler</center>

<p>It actually... got slower. Yes, the average execution time is 4x lower: 400 ms, but the scaling 
got much less aggressive too, which canceled the speedup.</p>
<p>I confirmed it with the largest instance size of 2,048 MB:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing//gcp-cloud-function-pubsub-cpubound-scaling-2048.png" alt="Google Cloud Function (2 GB) processing 100k Pub/Sub messages with &quot;Bcrypt&quot; handler"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Google Cloud Function (2 GB) processing 100k Pub/Sub messages with "Bcrypt" handler</center>

<p>CPU is fast: 160 ms average execution time, but the total time to process 100k messages went up 
to eight minutes. Beyond the initial spike at the first minute, it failed to scale up any further 
and stayed at about 110 concurrent executions.</p>
<p>It seems that GCP is not that keen to scale out larger instances. It&#39;s probably easier to find 
many small instances available on the pool rather than a similar number of giant instances.</p>
<h3 id="azure">Azure</h3>
<p>A single invocation takes about 400 ms to complete on Azure Function. Here is the burndown chart:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/11/from-0-to-1000-instances-how-serverless-providers-scale-queue-processing//azure-function-queue-cpubound-scaling.png" alt="Azure Function processing 100k queue messages with &quot;Bcrypt&quot; handler"></p>
<center class="img-caption">Azure Function processing 100k queue messages with "Bcrypt" handler</center>

<p>Azure spent 21 minutes to process the whole backlog. The scaling was linear, similarly to AWS, 
but with a much slower pace regarding instance size growth, about <code>2.5 * Minutes</code>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, each instance could process multiple queue messages in parallel, but each such 
execution would be competing for the same CPU resource, which doesn&#39;t help for the purely 
CPU-bound workload.</p>
<h2 id="practical-considerations">Practical Considerations</h2>
<p>Time for some conclusions and pieces of advice to apply in real serverless applications.</p>
<h3 id="serverless-is-great-for-async-data-processing">Serverless is great for async data processing</h3>
<p>If you are already using cloud services, such as managed queues and topics, serverless functions 
are the easiest way to consume them. </p>
<p>Moreover, the scalability is there too. When was the last time you ran 1,200 copies of your 
application?</p>
<h3 id="serverless-is-not-infinitely-scalable">Serverless is not infinitely scalable</h3>
<p>There are limits. Your functions won&#39;t scale perfectly to accommodate your spike&mdash;a 
provider-specific algorithm will determine the scaling pattern.</p>
<p>If you have large spikes in queue workloads, which is quite likely for medium- to high-load 
scenarios, you can and should expect delays up to several minutes before the backlog is fully 
digested.</p>
<p>All cloud providers have quotas and limits that define an upper boundary of scalability.</p>
<h3 id="cloud-providers-have-different-implementations">Cloud providers have different implementations</h3>
<p><strong>AWS Lambda</strong> seems to have a very consistent and well-documented linear scale growth for 
SQS-triggered Lambda functions. It will happily scale to 1,000 instances, or whatever other 
limit you hit first.</p>
<p><strong>Google Cloud Functions</strong> has the most aggressive scale-out strategy for the smallest instance 
sizes. It can be a cost-efficient and scalable way to run your queue-based workloads. Larger 
instances seem to scale in a more limited way, so a further investigation is required if you 
need those.</p>
<p><strong>Azure Functions</strong> share instances for multiple concurrent executions, which works better 
for I/O-bound workloads than for CPU-bound ones. Depending on the exact scenario that you 
have, it might help to play with instance-level settings.</p>
<h3 id="don-t-forget-batching">Don&#39;t forget batching</h3>
<p>For the tests, I was handling queue messages in the 1-by-1 fashion. In practice, it helps 
if you can batch several messages together and execute a single action for all of them in one go.</p>
<p>If the destination for your data supports batched operations, the throughput will usually 
increase immensely.

His scenario looks very familiar: He uses queue-triggered Azure Functions to notify 
subscribers about data breaches. One day, he dropped 126 million items into the queue, and Azure 
scaled out, which overloaded Mozilla&#39;s servers and caused them to go all-timeouts.</p>
<p>Another consideration is that non-serverless dependencies limit the scalability of your serverless 
application. If you call a legacy HTTP endpoint, a SQL database, or a third-party web service&mdash;be
sure to test how they react when your serverless function scales out to hundreds of concurrent 
executions.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more serverless performance goodness!</p>

        <title>Azure Functions V2 Is Released, How Performant Is It?</title>
        <link href="https://mikhail.io/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/"/>
        <updated>2018-10-10T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <id>tag:mikhail.io,2018-10-10,/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Azure Functions major version 2.0 was released into GA a few days back during Microsoft Ignite. The runtime is now
based on .NET Core and thus is cross-platform and more interoperable. It has a nice extensibility story too.</p>
<p>In theory, .NET Core runtime is more lean and performant.
But last time <a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers/">I checked back in April</a>,
the preview version of Azure Functions V2 had some serious issues with cold start durations.</p>
<p>I decided to give the new and shiny version another try and ran several benchmarks. All tests were conducted on 
Consumption plan.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: it&#39;s not perfect just yet.</p>
<h2 id="cold-starts">Cold Starts</h2>
<p>Cold starts happen when a new instance handles its first request, see my other posts:
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers/">one</a>,
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/05/azure-functions-cold-starts-beyond-first-load/">two</a>,
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war/">three</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hello-world">Hello World</h3>
<p>The following chart gives a comparison of V1 vs V2 cold starts for the two most popular runtimes:
.NET and Javascript. The dark bar shows the most probable range of values, while the light ones
are possible but less frequent:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/cold-starts-dotnet-js.png" alt="Cold Starts V1 vs V2: .NET and Javascript"></p>
<p>Apparently, V2 is slower to start for both runtimes. V2 on .NET is slower by 10% on average and seems 
to have higher variation. V2 on Javascript is massively slower: 2 times on average, and the slowest startup
time goes above 10 seconds.</p>
<h3 id="dependencies-on-board">Dependencies On Board</h3>
<p>The values for the previous chart were calculated for Hello-World type of functions with no extra dependencies.</p>
<p>The chart below shows two more Javascript functions, this time with a decent number of dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Referencing 3 NPM packages - 5MB zipped</li>
<li>Referencing 38 NPM packages - 35 MB zipped</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/cold-starts-js-dependencies.png" alt="Cold Starts V1 vs V2: Javascript with NPM dependencies"></p>
<p>V2 clearly loses on both samples, but V2-V1 difference seems to be consistently within 2.5-3
seconds for any amount of dependencies.</p>
<p>All the functions were deployed with the Run-from-Package method which promises faster startup times.</p>
<h3 id="java">Java</h3>
<p>Functions V2 come with a preview of a new runtime: Java / JVM. It utilizes the same extensibility model 
as Javascript, and thus it seems to be a first-class citizen now.</p>
<p>Cold starts are not first-class though: </p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/cold-starts-java.png" alt="Cold Starts Java"></p>
<p>If you are a Java developer, be prepared for 20-25 seconds of initial startup time. That will probably 
be resolved when the Java runtime becomes generally available:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That matches some of our internal data. We are looking into it.</p>&mdash; Paul Batum (@paulbatum) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulbatum/status/1048391445386735616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2 id="queue-processor">Queue Processor</h2>
<p>Cold starts are most problematic for synchronous triggers like HTTP requests. They are less relevant
for queue-based workloads, where scale out is of higher importance.</p>
<p>Last year I ran some tests around the ability of Functions to keep up with variable queue load:
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2017/08/azure-functions-are-they-really-infinitely-scalable-and-elastic/">one</a>,
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2017/12/azure-functions-get-more-scalable-and-elastic/">two</a>.</p>
<p>Today I ran two simple tests to compare the scalability of V1 vs. V2 runtimes.</p>
<h3 id="pause-and-go">Pause-and-Go</h3>
<p>In my first tests, a lightweight Javascript Function processed messages from an Azure Storage Queue. For
each message, it just pauses for 500 msec and then completes. This is supposed to simulate I/O-bound 
Functions.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve sent 100,000 messages to the queue and measured how fast they went away. Batch size (degree of parallelism
on each instance) was set to 16.</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/queue-scaling-io-based.png" alt="Processing Queue Messages with Lightweight I/O Workload"></p>
<p>Two lines show the queue backlogs of two runtimes, while the bars indicate the number of instances working
in parallel at a given minute.</p>
<p>We see that V2 was a bit faster to complete, probably due to more instances provisioned to it at any moment.
The difference is not big though and might be statistically insignificant.</p>
<h3 id="cpu-at-work">CPU at Work</h3>
<p>Functions in my second experiment are CPU-bound. Each message invokes calculation of a 10-stage Bcrypt
hash. On a very quiet moment, 1 such function call takes about 300-400 ms to complete, consuming 100% CPU 
load on a single core.</p>
<p>Both Functions are precompiled .NET and both are using <a href="https://github.com/BcryptNet/bcrypt.net">Bcrypt.NET</a>.</p>
<p>Batch size (degree of parallelism on each instance) was set to 2 to avoid too much fighting for the same CPU. Yet, 
the average call duration is about 1.5 seconds (3x slower than possible).</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/queue-scaling-cpu-bound.png" alt="Processing Queue Messages with CPU-bound Workload"></p>
<p>The first thing to notice: it&#39;s the same number of messages with comparable &quot;sequential&quot; execution time, but 
the total time to complete the job increased 3-fold. That&#39;s because the workload is much more demanding to
the resources of application instances, and they struggle to parallelize work more aggressively.</p>
<p>V1 and V2 are again close to each other. One more time, V2 got more instances allocated to it most of the time.
And yet, it seemed to be <em>consistently</em> slower and lost about 2.5 minutes on 25 minutes interval (~10%).</p>
<h2 id="http-scalability">HTTP Scalability</h2>
<p>I ran two similar Functions &mdash; I/O-bound &quot;Pause&quot; (~100 ms) and CPU-bound Bcrypt (9 stages, ~150ms) &mdash; under a stress test.
But this time they were triggered by HTTP requests. Then I compared the results for V1 and V2.</p>
<h3 id="pause-and-go">Pause-and-Go</h3>
<p>The grey bars on the following charts represent the rate of requests sent and processed within a given minute.</p>
<p>The lines are percentiles of response time: green lines for V2 and orange lines for V1.</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/http-scaling-io-based.png" alt="Processing HTTP Requests with Lightweight I/O Workload"></p>
<p>Yes, you saw it right, my Azure Functions were processing 100,000 messages per minute at peak. That&#39;s a lot of
messages.</p>
<p>Apart from the initial spike at minutes 2 and 3, both versions performed pretty close to each other.</p>
<p>50th percentile is flat close to the theoretic minimum of 100 ms, while the 95th percentile fluctuates a bit, but still
mostly stays quite low. </p>
<p>Note that the response time is measured from the client perspective, not by looking at the statistics provided by Azure.</p>
<h3 id="cpu-fanout">CPU Fanout</h3>
<p>How did CPU-heavy workload perform?</p>
<p>To skip ahead, I must say that the response time increased much more significantly, so my sample clients were
not able to generate request rates of 100k per minute. They &quot;only&quot; did about 48k per minute at peak, which still
seems massive to me.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve run the same test twice: one for Bcrypt implemented in .NET, and one for Javascript.</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/http-scaling-cpu-bound-dotnet.png" alt="Processing HTTP Requests with .NET CPU-bound Workload"></p>
<p>V2 had a real struggle during the first minute, where response time got terribly slow up to 9 seconds.</p>
<p>Looking at the bold-green 50th percentile, we can see that it&#39;s consistently higher than the orange one throughout
the load growth period of the first 10 minutes. V2 seemed to have a harder time to adjust.</p>
<p>This might be explainable by slower growth of instance count:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/http-scaling-cpu-bound-dotnet-instance-growth.png" alt="Instance Count Growth while Processing HTTP Requests with .NET CPU-bound Workload"></p>
<p>This difference could be totally random, so let&#39;s look at a similar test with Javascript worker. Here is the percentile chart:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/http-scaling-cpu-bound-js.png" alt="Processing HTTP Requests with Javascript CPU-bound Workload"></p>
<p>The original slowness of the first 3 minutes is still there, but after that time V2 and V1 are on-par.</p>
<p>On-par doesn&#39;t sound that great though if you look at the significant edge in the number of allocated instances, in
favor of V2 this time:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/http-scaling-cpu-bound-js-instance-growth.png" alt="Instance Count Growth while Processing HTTP Requests with Javascript CPU-bound Workload"></p>
<p>Massive 147 instances were crunching Bcrypt hashes in Javascript V2, and that made it a bit faster to respond than V1.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As always, be reluctant to make definite conclusions based on simplistic benchmarks. But I see some trends which might
be true as of today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance of .NET Functions is comparable across two versions of Functions runtimes;</li>
<li>V1 still has a clear edge in the cold start time of Javascript Functions;</li>
<li>V2 is the only option for Java developers, but be prepared to very slow cold starts;</li>
<li>Scale-out characteristics seem to be independent of the runtime version, although there are blurry signs of
V2 being a bit slower to ramp up or slightly more resource hungry.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps in your serverless journey!</p>

        <title>Serverless: Cold Start War</title>
        <link href="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war/"/>
        <updated>2018-08-30T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <id>tag:mikhail.io,2018-08-30,/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war/</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Serverless cloud services are hot. Except when they are not :)</p>
<p>AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions are all similar in their attempt
to enable rapid development of cloud-native serverless applications.</p>
<p>Auto-provisioning and auto-scalability are the killer features of those Function-as-a-Service
cloud offerings. No management required, cloud providers will deliver infrastructure for the user
based on the actual incoming load.</p>
<p>One drawback of such dynamic provisioning is a phenomenon called &quot;cold start&quot;. Basically,
applications that haven&#39;t been used for a while take longer to startup and to handle the
first request.</p>
<p>Cloud providers keep a bunch of generic unspecialized workers in stock. Whenever a serverless
application needs to scale up, be it from 0 to 1 instances, or from N to N+1 likewise, the runtime
will pick one of the spare workers and will configure it to serve the named application:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war//coldstart.png" alt="Cold Start"></p>
<p>This procedure takes time, so the latency of the application event handling increases. To avoid
doing this for every event, the specialized worker will be kept intact for some period of time.
When another event comes in, this worker will stand available to process it as soon as possible.
This is a &quot;warm start&quot;:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war//warmstart.png" alt="Warm Start"></p>
<p>The problem of cold start latency was described multiple times, here are the notable links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2018/02/07/understanding-serverless-cold-start/">Understanding Serverless Cold Start</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hackernoon.com/cold-starts-in-aws-lambda-f9e3432adbf0">Everything you need to know about cold starts in AWS Lambda</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The goal of my article today is to explore how cold starts compare:</p>
<ul>
<li>Across Big-3 cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google)</li>
<li>For different languages and runtimes</li>
<li>For smaller vs larger applications (including dependencies)</li>
<li>How often cold starts happen</li>
<li>What can be done to optimize the cold starts</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s see how I did that and what the outcome was.</p>
<p><em>DISCLAIMER. Performance testing is hard. I might be missing some important factors and parameters that
influence the outcome. My interpretation might be wrong. The results might change over time. If you happen 
to know a way to improve my tests, please let me know and I will re-run them and re-publish the results.</em></p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>All tests were run against HTTP Functions because that&#39;s where cold start matters the most. </p>
<p>All the functions were returning a simple JSON reporting their current instance ID, language etc.
Some functions were also loading extra dependencies, see below.</p>
<p>I did not rely on execution time reported by a cloud provider. Instead, I measured end-to-end duration from
the client perspective. This means that durations of HTTP gateway (e.g. API Gateway in case of AWS) are included
into the total duration. However, all calls were made from within the same region, so network latency should 
have minimal impact:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war//test-setup.png" alt="Test Setup"></p>
<p>Important note: I ran all my tests on GA (generally available) versions of services/languages, so e.g.
Azure tests were done with version 1 of Functions runtime (.NET Framework), and GCP tests were only made for
Javascript runtime.</p>
<h2 id="when-does-cold-start-happen-">When Does Cold Start Happen?</h2>
<p>Obviously, cold start happens when the very first request comes in. After that request is processed,
the instance is kept alive in case subsequent requests arrive. But for how long?</p>
<p>The answer differs between cloud providers.</p>
<p>To help you read the charts in this section, I&#39;ve marked cold starts with blue color dots, and warm starts
with orange color dots.</p>
<h3 id="azure">Azure</h3>
<p>Here is the chart for Azure. It shows the values of normalized request durations across
different languages and runtime versions (Y-axis) depending on the time since the previous
request in minutes (X-axis):</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war//azure-coldstart-threshold.png" alt="Azure Cold Start Threshold"></p>
<p>Clearly, an idle instance lives for 20 minutes and then gets recycled. All requests after 20 minutes
threshold hit another cold start.</p>
<h3 id="aws">AWS</h3>
<p>AWS is more tricky. Here is the same kind of chart, relative durations vs time since the last request, 
measured for AWS Lambda:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war//aws-coldstart-threshold.png" alt="AWS Cold Start vs Warm Start"></p>
<p>There&#39;s no clear threshold here... For this sample, no cold starts happened within 28 minutes after the previous 
invocation. Afterward, the frequency of cold starts slowly rises. But even after 1 hour of inactivity, there&#39;s still a
good chance that your instance is alive and ready to take requests.</p>
<p>This doesn&#39;t match the official information that AWS Lambdas stay alive for just 5 minutes after the last
invocation. I reached out to Chris Munns, and he confirmed:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">
So what you are seeing is very much possible as the team plays with certain knobs/levers for execution environment lifecycle. 
let me know if you have concerns about it, but it should be just fine</p>&mdash; chrismunns (@chrismunns) 
<a href="https://twitter.com/chrismunns/status/1021452964630851585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2018</a>
</blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>A couple learning points here:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS is working on improving cold start experience (and probably Azure/GCP do too)</li>
<li>My results might not be reliably reproducible in your application since it&#39;s affected by recent adjustments</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gcp">GCP</h3>
<p>Google Cloud Functions left me completely puzzled. Here is the same chart for GCP cold starts (again,
orange dots are warm and blue ones are cold):</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war//gcp-coldstart-threshold.png" alt="GCP Cold Start vs Warm Start"></p>
<p>This looks totally random to me. A cold start can happen in 3 minutes after the previous request, or an instance
can be kept alive for the whole hour. The probability of a cold start doesn&#39;t seem to depend on the interval,
at least just by looking at this chart.</p>
<p>Any ideas about what&#39;s going on are welcome!</p>
<h3 id="parallel-requests">Parallel requests</h3>
<p>Cold starts happen not only when the first instance of an application is provisioned. The same issue will happen whenever
all the provisioned instances are busy handling incoming events, and yet another event comes in (at scale out).</p>
<p>As far as I&#39;m aware, this behavior is common to all 3 providers, so I haven&#39;t prepared any comparison charts
for N+1 cold starts. Yet, be aware of them!</p>
<h2 id="reading-candle-charts">Reading Candle Charts</h2>
<p>In the following sections, you will see charts that represent statistical distribution of cold start time as
measured during my experiments. I repeated experiments multiple times and then grouped the metric values, e.g.
by the cloud provider or by language.</p>
<p>Each group will be represented by a &quot;candle&quot; on the chart. This is how you should read each candle:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war//sample-coldstart-chart.png" alt="How to Read Cold Start Charts"></p>
<h2 id="memory-allocation">Memory Allocation</h2>
<p>AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions have a setting to define the memory size that gets allocated to a single
instance of a function. A user can select a value from 128MB to 2GB and above at creation time.</p>
<p>More importantly, the virtual CPU cycles get allocated proportionally to this provisioned memory size. This means
that an instance of 512 MB will have twice as much CPU speed as an instance of 256MB.</p>
<p>Does this affect the cold start time?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve run a series of tests to compare cold start latency across the board of memory/CPU sizes. The results are
somewhat mixed.</p>
<p>AWS Lambda Javascript doesn&#39;t seem to have significant differences. This probably means that not so much CPU load
is required to start a Node.js &quot;Hello World&quot; application:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war//aws-coldstart-js-by-memory.png" alt="AWS Javascript Cold Start by Memory"></p>
<p>AWS Lambda .NET Core runtime does depend on memory size though. Cold start time drops dramatically with every increase
in allocated memory and CPU:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war//aws-coldstart-csharp-by-memory.png" alt="AWS C# Cold Start by Memory"></p>
<p>GCP Cloud Functions expose a similar effect even for Javascript runtime:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war//gcp-coldstart-js-by-memory.png" alt="GCP Javascript Cold Start by Memory"></p>
<p>In contrast to Amazon and Google, Microsoft doesn&#39;t ask to select a memory limit. Azure will charge Functions based 
on the actual memory usage. More importantly, it will always dedicate a full vCore for a given Function execution.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not exactly apples-to-apples, but I chose to fix the memory allocations of AWS Lambda and GCF to 1024 MB.
This feels the closest to Azure&#39;s vCore capacity, although I haven&#39;t tried a formal CPU performance comparison.</p>
<p>Given that, let&#39;s see how the 3 cloud providers compare in cold start time.</p>
<h2 id="javascript-baseline">Javascript Baseline</h2>
<p>Node.js is the only runtime supported in production by Google Cloud Functions right now. Javascript is also
probably by far the most popular language for serverless applications across the board.</p>
<p>Thus, it makes sense to compare the 3 cloud providers on how they perform in Javascript. The
base test measures the cold starts of &quot;Hello World&quot; type of functions. Functions have no 
dependencies, so deployment package is really small.</p>
<p>Here are the numbers for cold starts:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war//coldstart-js-baseline.png" alt="Cold Start for Basic Javascript Functions"></p>
<p>AWS is clearly doing the best job here. GCP takes the second place, and Azure is the slowest. The rivals are
sort of close though, seemingly playing in the same league so the exact disposition might change over time.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-languages-compare-">How Do Languages Compare?</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve written Hello World HTTP function in all supported languages of the cloud platforms: </p>
<ul>
<li>AWS: Javascript, Python, Java, Go and C# (.NET Core)</li>
<li>Azure: Javascript and C# (precompiled .NET assembly)</li>
<li>GCP: Javascript</li>
</ul>
<p>Azure kind of supports much more languages, including Python and Java, but they are still considered
experimental / preview, so the cold starts are not fully optimized. See 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers/">my previous article</a> for exact numbers.</p>
<p>Same applies to Python on GCP.</p>
<p>The following chart shows some intuition about the cold start duration per language. The languages
are ordered based on mean response time, from lowest to highest:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war//coldstart-per-language.png" alt="Cold Start per Language per Cloud and Language"></p>
<p>AWS provides the richest selection of runtimes, and 4 out of 5 are faster than the other two cloud providers.
C# / .NET seems to be the least optimized (Amazon, why is that?).</p>
<h2 id="does-size-matter-">Does Size Matter?</h2>
<p>OK, enough of Hello World. A real-life function might be more heavy, mainly because it would
depend on other third-party libraries.</p>
<p>To simulate such scenario, I&#39;ve measured cold starts for functions with extra dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Javascript referencing 3 NPM packages - 5MB zipped</li>
<li>Javascript referencing 38 NPM packages - 35 MB zipped</li>
<li>C# function referencing 5 NuGet packages - 2 MB zipped</li>
<li>Java function referencing 5 Maven packages - 15 MB zipped</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the results:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war//coldstart-dependencies.png" alt="Cold Start Dependencies"></p>
<p>As expected, the dependencies slow the loading down. You should keep your Functions lean,
otherwise, you will pay in seconds for every cold start.</p>
<p>However, the increase in cold start seems quite low, especially for precompiled languages.</p>
<p>A very cool feature of GCP Cloud Functions is that you don&#39;t have to include NPM packages into
the deployment archive. You just add <code>package.json</code> file and the runtime will restore them for you.
This makes the deployment artifact ridiculously small, but doesn&#39;t seem to slow down the cold
starts either. Obviously, Google pre-restores the packages in advance, before the actual request 
comes in.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-cold-starts">Avoiding Cold Starts</h2>
<p>The overall impression is that cold start delays aren&#39;t that high, so most applications can tolerate
them just fine.</p>
<p>If that&#39;s not the case, some tricks can be implemented to keep function instances warm.
The approach is universal for all 3 providers: once in X minutes, make an artificial call to
the function to prevent it from expiring.</p>
<p>Implementation details will differ since the expiration policies are different, as we explored
above.</p>
<p>For applications with higher load profile, you might want to fire several parallel &quot;warming&quot;
requests in order to make sure that enough instances are kept in warm stock.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Here are some lessons learned from all the experiments above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be prepared for 1-3 seconds cold starts even for the smallest Functions</li>
<li>Different languages and runtimes have roughly comparable cold start time within the same platform</li>
<li>Minimize the number of dependencies, only bring what&#39;s needed</li>
<li>AWS keeps cold starts below 1 second most of the time, which is pretty amazing</li>
<li>All cloud providers are aware of the problem and are actively optimizing the cold start experience</li>
<li>It&#39;s likely that in middle term these optimizations will make cold starts a non-issue for the
vast majority of applications</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Out of curiosity, I&#39;m currently investigating cold starts of Function-as-a-Service platforms of major cloud providers. Basically,
if a function is not called for several minutes, the cloud instance behind it might be recycled, and then the next request will
take longer because a new instance will need to be provisioned.</p>
<p>Recently, Jeremy Daly <a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/lambda-warmer-optimize-aws-lambda-function-cold-starts/">posted</a> a nice
article about the proper way to keep AWS Lambda instances &quot;warm&quot; to (mostly) prevent cold starts with minimal overhead.
Chris Munns <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismunns/status/1017777028274294784">endorsed</a> the article, so we know it&#39;s the right way.</p>
<p>The amount of actions to be taken is quite significant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a CloudWatch event which would fire every 5 minutes</li>
<li>Bind this event as another trigger for your Lambda</li>
<li>Inside the Lambda, detect whether current invocation is triggered by our CloudWatch event</li>
<li>If so, short-circuit the execution and return immediately; otherwise, run the normal workload</li>
<li>(Bonus point) If you want to keep multiple instances alive, do some extra dancing with calling itself N times in parallel,
provided by an extra permission to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pursuing-reusability">Pursuing Reusability</h2>
<p>To simplify this for his readers, Jeremy was so kind to</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an NPM package which you can install and then call from a function-to-be-warmed</li>
<li>Provide SAM and Serverless Framework templates to automate Cloud Watch integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are still two distinct steps: writing the code (JS + NPM) and provisioning the cloud resources (YAML + CLI). There are some
drawbacks to that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to change two parts, which don&#39;t look like each other</li>
<li>They have to work in sync, e.g. Cloud Watch event must provide the right payload for the handler</li>
<li>There&#39;s still some boilerplate for every new Lambda</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pulumi-components">Pulumi Components</h2>
<p>Pulumi takes a different approach. You can blend the application code and infrastructure management code
into one cohesive cloud application.</p>
<p>Related resources can be combined together into reusable components, which hide repetitive stuff behind code abstractions.</p>
<p>One way to define an AWS Lambda with Typescript in Pulumi is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">const handler = (event: any, context: any, callback: (error: any, result: any) =&gt; void) =&gt; {
    const response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: &quot;Cheers, how are things?&quot;
      };

    callback(null, response);
};

const lambda = new aws.serverless.Function(&quot;my-function&quot;, { /* options */ }, handler);</code></pre>
<p>The processing code <code>handler</code> is just passed to infrastructure code as a parameter.</p>
<p>So, if I wanted to make reusable API for an &quot;always warm&quot; function, how would it look like?</p>
<p>From the client code perspective, I just want to be able to do the same thing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">const lambda = new mylibrary.WarmLambda(&quot;my-warm-function&quot;, { /* options */ }, handler);</code></pre>
<p>CloudWatch? Event subscription? Short-circuiting? They are implementation details!</p>
<h2 id="warm-lambda">Warm Lambda</h2>
<p>Here is how to implement such component. The declaration starts with a Typescript class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">export class WarmLambda extends pulumi.ComponentResource {
    public lambda: aws.lambda.Function;

    // Implementation goes here...
}</code></pre>
<p>We expose the raw Lambda Function object, so that it could be used for further bindings and retrieving outputs.</p>
<p>The constructor accepts the same parameters as <code>aws.serverless.Function</code> provided by Pulumi:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">constructor(name: string,
        options: aws.serverless.FunctionOptions,
        handler: aws.serverless.Handler,
        opts?: pulumi.ResourceOptions) {

    // Subresources are created here...
}</code></pre>
<p>We start resource provisioning by creating the CloudWatch rule to be triggered every 5 minutes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">const eventRule = new aws.cloudwatch.EventRule(`${name}-warming-rule`, 
    { scheduleExpression: &quot;rate(5 minutes)&quot; },
    { parent: this, ...opts }
);</code></pre>
<p>Then goes the cool trick. We substitute the user-provided handler with our own &quot;outer&quot; handler. This handler closes
over <code>eventRule</code>, so it can use the rule to identify the warm-up event coming from CloudWatch. If such is identified,
the handler short-circuits to the callback. Otherwise, it passes the event over to the original handler:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">const outerHandler = (event: any, context: aws.serverless.Context, callback: (error: any, result: any) =&gt; void) =&gt;
{
    if (event.resources &amp;&amp; event.resources[0] &amp;&amp; event.resources[0].includes(eventRule.name.get())) {
        console.log(&#39;Warming...&#39;);
        callback(null, &quot;warmed!&quot;);
    } else {
        console.log(&#39;Running the real handler...&#39;);
        handler(event, context, callback);
    }
};</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s a great example of synergy enabled by doing both application code and application infrastructure in a
single program. I&#39;m free to mix and match objects from both worlds.</p>
<p>It&#39;s time to bind both <code>eventRule</code> and <code>outerHandler</code> to a new serverless function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">const func = new aws.serverless.Function(
    `${name}-warmed`, 
    options, 
    outerHandler, 
    { parent: this, ...opts });
this.lambda = func.lambda;            </code></pre>
<p>Finally, I create an event subscription from CloudWatch schedule to Lambda:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">this.subscription = new serverless.cloudwatch.CloudwatchEventSubscription(
    `${name}-warming-subscription`, 
    eventRule,
    this.lambda,
    { },
    { parent: this, ...opts });</code></pre>
<p>And that&#39;s all we need for now! See the full code 
<a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/pulumi-serverless-examples/blob/master/WarmedLambda-TypeScript/warmLambda.ts">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the output of <code>pulumi update</code> command for my sample &quot;warm&quot; lambda application:</p>
<pre><code>     Type                                                      Name                            Plan

 +    samples:WarmLambda                                       i-am-warm                       create
 +      aws-serverless:cloudwatch:CloudwatchEventSubscription  i-am-warm-warming-subscription  create
 +        aws:lambda:Permission                                i-am-warm-warming-subscription  create
 +        aws:cloudwatch:EventTarget                           i-am-warm-warming-subscription  create
 +      aws:cloudwatch:EventRule                               i-am-warm-warming-rule          create
 +      aws:serverless:Function                                i-am-warm-warmed                create
 +         aws:lambda:Function                                 i-am-warm-warmed                create</code></pre><p>7 Pulumi components and 4 AWS cloud resources are provisioned by one <code>new WarmLambda()</code> line.</p>
<h2 id="multi-instance-warming">Multi-Instance Warming</h2>
<p>Jeremy&#39;s library supports warming several instances of Lambda by issuing parallel self-calls.</p>
<p>Reproducing the same with Pulumi component should be fairly straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add an extra constructor option to accept the number of instances to keep warm</li>
<li>Add a permission to call Lambda from itself</li>
<li>Fire N calls when warming event is triggered</li>
<li>Short-circuit those calls in each instance</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that only the first item would be visible to the client code. That&#39;s the power of componentization
and code reuse.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t need multi-instance warming, so I&#39;ll leave the implementation as exercise for the reader.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Obligatory note: most probably, you don&#39;t need to add warming to your AWS Lambdas.</p>
<p>But whatever advanced scenario you might have, it&#39;s likely that it is easier to express the scenario
in terms of general-purpose reusable component, rather than a set of guidelines or templates.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>

        <title>Getting Started with AWS Lambda in Pulumi</title>
        <link href="https://mikhail.io/2018/07/getting-started-with-aws-lambda-in-pulumi/"/>
        <updated>2018-07-12T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <id>tag:mikhail.io,2018-07-12,/2018/07/getting-started-with-aws-lambda-in-pulumi/</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a small research project of mine, I needed to create HTTP triggered
AWS Lambda&#39;s in all supported programming languages.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a power AWS user, so I get easily confused about the configuration
of things like IAM roles or API Gateway. Moreover, I wanted my environment to
be reproducible, so manual AWS Console wasn&#39;t a good option.</p>
<p>I decided it was a good job for Pulumi. They pay a lot of attention to
serverless and especially AWS Lambda, and I love the power of 
configuration as code.</p>
<p>I created a Pulumi program which provisions Lambda&#39;s running on Javascript,
.NET, Python, Java and Go. Pulumi program itself is written in Javascript.</p>
<p>I&#39;m describing the resulting code below in case folks need to do the same thing.
The code itself is on <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/pulumi-aws-serverless-examples">my github</a>.</p>
<h2 id="javascript">Javascript</h2>
<p>Probably, the vast majority of Pulumi + AWS Lambda users will be using
Javascript as programming language for their serverless functions.</p>
<p>No wonder that this scenario is the easiest to start with. There is a
high-level package <code>@pulumi/cloud-aws</code> which hides all the AWS machinery from
a developer. </p>
<p>The simplest function will consist of just several lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const cloud = require(&quot;@pulumi/cloud-aws&quot;);

const api = new cloud.API(&quot;aws-hellolambda-js&quot;);
api.get(&quot;/js&quot;, (req, res) =&gt; {
    res.status(200).json(&quot;Hi from Javascript lambda&quot;);
});

exports.endpointJs = api.publish().url;</code></pre>
<p>Configure your Pulumi stack, run <code>pulumi update</code> and a Lambda 
is up, running and accessible via HTTP.</p>
<h2 id="-net-core">.NET Core</h2>
<p>.NET is my default development environment and AWS Lambda supports .NET Core
as execution runtime.</p>
<p>Pulumi program is still Javascript, so it can&#39;t mix C# code in. Thus, the setup
looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a .NET Core 2.0 application written in C# and utilizing
<code>Amazon.Lambda.*</code> NuGet packages</li>
<li>I build and publish this application with <code>dotnet</code> CLI</li>
<li>Pulumi then utilizes the published binaries to create deployment artifacts</li>
</ul>
<p>C# function looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class Functions
{
    public async Task&lt;APIGatewayProxyResponse&gt; GetAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext context)
    {
        return new APIGatewayProxyResponse
        {
            StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.OK,
            Body = &quot;\&quot;Hi from C# Lambda\&quot;&quot;,
            Headers = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; { { &quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;application/json&quot; } }
        };
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>For non-Javascript lambdas I utilize <code>@pulumi/aws</code> package. It&#39;s of lower level
than <code>@pulumi/cloud-aws</code>, so I had to setup IAM first:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const aws = require(&quot;@pulumi/aws&quot;);

const policy = {
    &quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;,
    &quot;Statement&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;sts:AssumeRole&quot;,
            &quot;Principal&quot;: {
                &quot;Service&quot;: &quot;lambda.amazonaws.com&quot;,
            },
            &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,
            &quot;Sid&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
        },
    ],
};
const role = new aws.iam.Role(&quot;precompiled-lambda-role&quot;, {
    assumeRolePolicy: JSON.stringify(policy),
});</code></pre>
<p>And then I did a raw definition of AWS Lambda:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const pulumi = require(&quot;@pulumi/pulumi&quot;);

const csharpLambda = new aws.lambda.Function(&quot;aws-hellolambda-csharp&quot;, {
    runtime: aws.lambda.DotnetCore2d0Runtime,
    code: new pulumi.asset.AssetArchive({
        &quot;.&quot;: new pulumi.asset.FileArchive(&quot;./csharp/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/publish&quot;),
    }),
    timeout: 5,
    handler: &quot;app::app.Functions::GetAsync&quot;,
    role: role.arn
});</code></pre>
<p>Note the path to <code>publish</code> folder, which should match the path created by
<code>dotnet publish</code>, and the handler name matching C# class/method.</p>
<p>Finally, I used <code>@pulumi/aws-serverless</code> to define API Gateway endpoint for
the lambda:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const serverless = require(&quot;@pulumi/aws-serverless&quot;);

const precompiledApi = new serverless.apigateway.API(&quot;aws-hellolambda-precompiledapi&quot;, {
    routes: [
        { method: &quot;GET&quot;, path: &quot;/csharp&quot;, handler: csharpLambda },
    ],
});</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s definitely more ceremony compared to Javascript version. But hey, it&#39;s
code, so if you find yourself repeating the same code, go ahead and make a
higher order component out of it, incapsulating the repetitive logic.</p>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>Pulumi supports Python as scripting language, but I&#39;m sticking to Javascript
for uniform experience.</p>
<p>In this case, the flow is similar to .NET but simpler: no compilation step
is required. Just define a <code>handler.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def handler(event, context): 
    return {
        &#39;statusCode&#39;: 200,
        &#39;headers&#39;: {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;},
        &#39;body&#39;: &#39;&quot;Hi from Python lambda&quot;&#39;
    }</code></pre>
<p>and package it into zip in AWS lambda definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const pythonLambda = new aws.lambda.Function(&quot;aws-hellolambda-python&quot;, {
    runtime: aws.lambda.Python3d6Runtime,
    code: new pulumi.asset.AssetArchive({
        &quot;.&quot;: new pulumi.asset.FileArchive(&quot;./python&quot;),
    }),
    timeout: 5,
    handler: &quot;handler.handler&quot;,
    role: role.arn
});</code></pre>
<p>I&#39;m reusing the <code>role</code> definition from above. The API definition will also
be the same as for .NET.</p>
<h2 id="go">Go</h2>
<p>Golang is a compiled language, so the approach is similar to .NET: write code,
build, reference the built artifact from Pulumi.</p>
<p>My Go function looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func Handler(request events.APIGatewayProxyRequest) (events.APIGatewayProxyResponse, error) {

 return events.APIGatewayProxyResponse{
  Body:       &quot;\&quot;Hi from Golang lambda\&quot;&quot;,
  StatusCode: 200,
 }, nil

}</code></pre>
<p>Because I&#39;m on Windows but AWS Lambda runs on Linux, I had to use 
<a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go"><code>build-lambda-zip</code></a> 
tool to make the package compatible. Here is the PowerShell build script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">$env:GOOS = &quot;linux&quot;
$env:GOARCH = &quot;amd64&quot;
go build -o main main.go
~\Go\bin\build-lambda-zip.exe -o main.zip main</code></pre>
<p>and Pulumi function definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const golangLambda = new aws.lambda.Function(&quot;aws-hellolambda-golang&quot;, {
    runtime: aws.lambda.Go1dxRuntime,
    code: new pulumi.asset.FileArchive(&quot;./go/main.zip&quot;),
    timeout: 5,
    handler: &quot;main&quot;,
    role: role.arn
});</code></pre>
<h2 id="java">Java</h2>
<p>Java class implements an interface from AWS SDK:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Hello implements RequestStreamHandler {

    public void handleRequest(InputStream inputStream, OutputStream outputStream, Context context) throws IOException {

        JSONObject responseJson = new JSONObject();

        responseJson.put(&quot;isBase64Encoded&quot;, false);
        responseJson.put(&quot;statusCode&quot;, &quot;200&quot;);
        responseJson.put(&quot;body&quot;, &quot;\&quot;Hi from Java lambda\&quot;&quot;);  

        OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(outputStream, &quot;UTF-8&quot;);
        writer.write(responseJson.toJSONString());  
        writer.close();
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>I compiled this code with Maven (<code>mvn package</code>), which produced a <code>jar</code> file. AWS Lambda accepts
<code>jar</code> directly, but Pulumi&#39;s <code>FileArchive</code> is unfortunately crashing on trying
to read it.</p>
<p>As a workaround, I had to define a <code>zip</code> file with <code>jar</code> placed inside <code>lib</code>
folder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const javaLambda = new aws.lambda.Function(&quot;aws-coldstart-java&quot;, {
    code: new pulumi.asset.AssetArchive({
        &quot;lib/lambda-java-example-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar&quot;: new pulumi.asset.FileAsset(&quot;./java/target/lambda-java-example-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar&quot;),
    }),
    runtime: aws.lambda.Java8Runtime,
    timeout: 5,
    handler: &quot;example.Hello&quot;,
    role: role.arn
});</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The complete code for 5 lambda functions in 5 different programming languages
can be found in <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/pulumi-aws-serverless-examples">my github repository</a>.</p>
<p>Running <code>pulumi update</code> provisions 25 AWS resources in a matter of 1 minute,
so I can start playing with my test lambdas in no time.</p>
<p>And the best part: when I don&#39;t need them anymore, I run <code>pulumi destroy</code> and
my AWS Console is clean again!</p>
<p>Happy serverless moments!</p>

        <link href="https://mikhail.io/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again/"/>
        <updated>2018-07-05T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <id>tag:mikhail.io,2018-07-05,/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again/</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love functional programming for the simplicity that it brings.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I realize that learning functional programming is a challenging 
process. FP comes with a baggage of unfamiliar vocabulary that can be daunting for 
somebody coming from an object-oriented language like C#.</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again//functional-programming-word-cloud.png" alt="Functional Programming Word Cloud"></p>
<p><em>Some of functional lingo</em></p>
<p>&quot;Monad&quot; is probably the most infamous term from the list above. Monads have reputation of being 
something very abstract and very confusing. </p>
<h2 id="the-fallacy-of-monad-tutorials">The Fallacy of Monad Tutorials</h2>
<p>Numerous attempts were made to explain monads in simple definitions; and monad tutorials have become a
genre of its own. And yet, times and times again, they fail to enlighten the readers.</p>
<p>The shortest explanation of monads looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again//monoid-endofunctors.png" alt="A Monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors"></p>
<p>It&#39;s both mathematically correct and totally useless to anybody learning functional programming. To
understand this statement, one has to know the terms &quot;monoid&quot;, &quot;category&quot; and &quot;endofunctors&quot; and be able
to mentally compose them into something meaningful.</p>
<p>The same problem is apparent in most monad tutorials. They assume some pre-existing knowledge in
heads of their readers, and if that assumption fails, the tutorial doesn&#39;t click.</p>
<p>Focusing too much on mechanics of monads instead of explaining why they are important is another
common problem.</p>
<p>Douglas Crockford grasped this fallacy very well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The monadic curse is that once someone learns what monads are and how to use them, they lose the ability to explain them to other people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem here is likely the following. Every person who understands monads had their own path to
this knowledge. It hasn&#39;t come all at once, instead there was a series of steps, each giving an insight,
until the last final step made the puzzle complete.</p>
<p>But they don&#39;t remember the whole path anymore. They go online and blog about that very last step as
the key to understanding, joining the club of flawed explanations.</p>
<p>There is an actual <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/monads/monads-programming.pdf">academic paper from Tomas Petricek</a> 
that studies monad tutorials.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read that paper and a dozen of monad tutorials online. And of course, now I came up with my own.</p>
<p>I&#39;m probably doomed to fail too, at least for some readers. Yet, I know that many people found the
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/01/monads-explained-in-csharp/">previous version</a> of this article useful.</p>
<p>I based my explanation on examples from C# - the object-oriented language familiar to .NET developers.</p>
<h2 id="story-of-composition">Story of Composition</h2>
<p>The base element of each functional program is Function. In typed languages each function 
is just a mapping between the type of its input parameter and output parameter.
Such type can be annotated as <code>func: TypeA -&gt; TypeB</code>.</p>
<p>C# is object-oriented language, so we use methods to declare functions. There are two ways 
to define a method comparable to <code>func</code> function above. I can use static method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static class Mapper 
{
    static ClassB func(ClassA a) { ... }
}</code></pre>
<p>... or instance method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class ClassA 
{
    // Instance method
    ClassB func() { ... }
}</code></pre>
<p>Static form looks closer to the function annotation, but both ways are actually equivalent
for the purpose of our discussion. I will use instance methods in my examples, however all of
them could be written as static extension methods too.</p>
<p>How do we compose more complex workflows, programs and applications out of such simple
building blocks? A lot of patterns both in OOP and FP worlds revolve around this question.
And monads are one of the answers.</p>
<p>My sample code is going to be about conferences and speakers. The method implementations 
aren&#39;t really important, just watch the types carefully. There are 4 classes (types) and 
3 methods (functions):</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class Speaker 
{
    Talk NextTalk() { ... }
}

class Talk 
{
    Conference GetConference() { ... }
}

class Conference 
{
    City GetCity() { ... }
}

class City { ... }</code></pre>
<p>These methods are currently very easy to compose into a workflow:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static City NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    Talk talk = speaker.NextTalk();
    Conference conf = talk.GetConference();
    City city = conf.GetCity();
    return city;
}</code></pre>
<p>Because the return type of the previous step always matches the input type of the next step, we can
write it even shorter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static City NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .NextTalk()
        .GetConference()
        .GetCity();
}</code></pre>
<p>This code looks quite readable. It&#39;s concise and it flows from top to bottom, from left to right, 
similar to how we are used to read any text. There is not much noise too.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not what real codebases look like though, because there are multiple complications
along the happy composition path. Let&#39;s look at some of them.</p>
<h2 id="nulls">NULLs</h2>
<p>Any class instance in C# can be <code>null</code>. In the example above I might get runtime errors if
one of the methods ever returns <code>null</code> back.</p>
<p>Typed functional programming always tries to be explicit about types, so I&#39;ll re-write the signatures
of my methods to annotate the return types as nullables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class Speaker 
{
    Nullable&lt;Talk&gt; NextTalk() { ... }
}

class Talk 
{
    Nullable&lt;Conference&gt; GetConference() { ... }
}

class Conference 
{
    Nullable&lt;City&gt; GetCity() { ... }
}

class City { ... }</code></pre>
<p>This is actually invalid syntax in current C# version, because <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> and its short form
<code>T?</code> are not applicable to reference types. This <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/11/15/nullable-reference-types-in-csharp/">might change in C# 8</a>
though, so bear with me.</p>
<p>Now, when composing our workflow, we need to take care of <code>null</code> results:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static Nullable&lt;City&gt; NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    Nullable&lt;Talk&gt; talk = speaker.NextTalk();
    if (talk == null) return null;

    Nullable&lt;Conference&gt; conf = talk.GetConference();
    if (conf == null) return null;

    Nullable&lt;City&gt; city = conf.GetCity();
    return city;
}</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s still the same method, but it got more noise now. Even though I used short-circuit returns
and one-liners, it still got harder to read.</p>
<p>To fight that problem, smart language designers came up with the Null Propagation Operator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static Nullable&lt;City&gt; NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        ?.NextTalk()
        ?.GetConference()
        ?.GetCity();
}</code></pre>
<p>Now we are almost back to our original workflow code: it&#39;s clean and concise, we just got
3 extra <code>?</code> symbols around.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take another leap.</p>
<h2 id="collections">Collections</h2>
<p>Quite often a function returns a collection of items, not just a single item. To some extent,
that&#39;s a generalization of <code>null</code> case: with <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> we might get 0 or 1 results back,
while with a collection we can get <code>0</code> to any <code>n</code> results.</p>
<p>Our sample API could look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class Speaker 
{
    List&lt;Talk&gt; GetTalks() { ... }
}

class Talk 
{
    List&lt;Conference&gt; GetConferences() { ... }
}

class Conference 
{
    List&lt;City&gt; GetCities() { ... }
}</code></pre>
<p>I used <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> but it could be any class or plain <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> interface.</p>
<p>How would we combine the methods into one workflow? Traditional version would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static List&lt;City&gt; AllCitiesToVisit(Speaker speaker) 
{
    var result = new List&lt;City&gt;();

    foreach (Talk talk in speaker.GetTalks())
        foreach (Conference conf in talk.GetConferences())
            foreach (City city in conf.GetCities())
                result.Add(city);

    return result;
}</code></pre>
<p>It reads ok-ish still. But the combination of nested loops and mutation with some conditionals sprinkled 
on them can get unreadable pretty soon. The exact workflow might be lost in the mechanics.</p>
<p>As an alternative, C# language designers invented LINQ extension methods. We can write code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static List&lt;City&gt; AllCitiesToVisit(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .GetTalks()
        .SelectMany(talk =&gt; talk.GetConferences())
        .SelectMany(conf =&gt; conf.GetCities())
        .ToList();
}</code></pre>
<p>Let me do one further trick and format the same code in an unusual way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static List&lt;City&gt; AllCitiesToVisit(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .GetTalks()           .SelectMany(x =&gt; x
        .GetConferences()    ).SelectMany(x =&gt; x
        .GetCities()         ).ToList();
}</code></pre>
<p>Now you can see the same original code on the left, combined with just a bit of technical repeatable
clutter on the right. Hold on, I&#39;ll show you where I&#39;m going.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s discuss another possible complication.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-calls">Asynchronous Calls</h2>
<p>What if our methods need to access some remote database or service to produce the results? This
should be shown in type signature, and C# has <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> for that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class Speaker 
{
    Task&lt;Talk&gt; NextTalk() { ... }
}

class Talk 
{
    Task&lt;Conference&gt; GetConference() { ... }
}

class Conference 
{
    Task&lt;City&gt; GetCity() { ... }
}</code></pre>
<p>This change breaks our nice workflow composition again.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll get back to async-await later, but the original way to combine <code>Task</code>-based
methods was to use <code>ContinueWith</code> and <code>Unwrap</code> API:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static Task&lt;City&gt; NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .NextTalk()
        .ContinueWith(talk =&gt; talk.Result.GetConference())
        .Unwrap()
        .ContinueWith(conf =&gt; conf.Result.GetCity())
        .Unwrap();
}</code></pre>
<p>Hard to read, but let me apply my formatting trick again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static Task&lt;City&gt; NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .NextTalk()         .ContinueWith(x =&gt; x.Result
        .GetConference()   ).Unwrap().ContinueWith(x =&gt; x.Result
        .GetCity()         ).Unwrap();
}</code></pre>
<p>You can see that, once again, it&#39;s our nice readable workflow on the left + some mechanical repeatable
junction code on the right.</p>
<h2 id="pattern">Pattern</h2>
<p>Can you see a pattern yet?</p>
<p>I&#39;ll repeat the <code>Nullable</code>-, <code>List</code>- and <code>Task</code>-based workflows again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static Nullable&lt;City&gt; NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker               ?
        .NextTalk()           ?
        .GetConference()      ?
        .GetCity();
}

static List&lt;City&gt; AllCitiesToVisit(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .GetTalks()            .SelectMany(x =&gt; x
        .GetConferences()     ).SelectMany(x =&gt; x
        .GetCities()          ).ToList();
}

static Task&lt;City&gt; NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .NextTalk()            .ContinueWith(x =&gt; x.Result
        .GetConference()      ).Unwrap().ContinueWith(x =&gt; x.Result
        .GetCity()            ).Unwrap();
}</code></pre>
<p>In all 3 cases there was a complication which prevented us from sequencing method
calls fluently. In all 3 cases we found the gluing code to get back to fluent composition.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s try to generalize this approach. Given some generic container type 
<code>WorkflowThatReturns&lt;T&gt;</code>, we have a method to combine an instance of such workflow with
a function which accepts the result of that workflow and returns another workflow back:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class WorkflowThatReturns&lt;T&gt; 
{
    WorkflowThatReturns&lt;U&gt; AddStep(Func&lt;T, WorkflowThatReturns&lt;U&gt;&gt; step);
}</code></pre>
<p>In case this is hard to grasp, have a look at the picture of what is going on:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again//monad-bind.png" alt="Monad Bind Internals"></p>
<ol>
<li><p>An instance of type <code>T</code> sits in a generic container.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We call <code>AddStep</code> with a function, which maps <code>T</code> to <code>U</code> sitting inside yet another
container. </p>
</li>
<li><p>We get an instance of <code>U</code> but inside two containers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two containers are automatically unwrapped into a single container to get back to the
original shape.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now we are ready to add another step!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following code, <code>NextTalk</code> returns the first instance inside the container:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">WorkflowThatReturns&lt;City&gt; Workflow(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .NextTalk()         
        .AddStep(x =&gt; x.GetConference())
        .AddStep(x =&gt; x.GetCity()); 
}</code></pre>
<p>Subsequently, <code>AddStep</code> is called two times to transfer to <code>Conference</code> and then
<code>City</code> inside the same container:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again//monad-two-binds.png" alt="Monad Bind Chaining"></p>
<h2 id="finally-monads">Finally, Monads</h2>
<p>The name of this pattern is <strong>Monad</strong>.</p>
<p>In C# terms, a Monad is a generic class with two operations: constructor and bind.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class Monad&lt;T&gt; {
    Monad(T instance);
    Monad&lt;U&gt; Bind(Func&lt;T, Monad&lt;U&gt;&gt; f);
}</code></pre>
<p>Constructor is used to put an object into container, <code>Bind</code> is used to replace one
contained object with another contained object.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important that <code>Bind</code>&#39;s argument returns <code>Monad&lt;U&gt;</code> and not just <code>U</code>. We can think
of <code>Bind</code> as a combination of <code>Map</code> and <code>Unwrap</code> as defined per following signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class Monad&lt;T&gt; {
    Monad(T instance);
    Monad&lt;U&gt; Map(Function&lt;T, U&gt; f);
    static Monad&lt;U&gt; Unwrap(Monad&lt;Monad&lt;U&gt;&gt; nested);
}</code></pre>
<p>Even though I spent quite some time with examples, I expect you to be slightly confused
at this point. That&#39;s ok.</p>
<p>Keep going and let&#39;s have a look at several sample implementations of Monad pattern.</p>
<p><a name="maybe" href="https://mikhail.io/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again/undefined"></a></p>
<h2 id="maybe-option-">Maybe (Option)</h2>
<p>My first motivational example was with <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>?.</code>. The full pattern
containing either 0 or 1 instance of some type is called <code>Maybe</code> (it maybe has a value,
or maybe not).</p>
<p><code>Maybe</code> is another approach to dealing with &#39;no value&#39; value, alternative to the 
concept of <code>null</code>. </p>
<p>Functional-first language F# typically doesn&#39;t allow <code>null</code> for its types. Instead, F# has 
a maybe implementation built into the language: 
it&#39;s called <code>option</code> type. </p>
<p>Here is a sample implementation in C#:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class Maybe&lt;T&gt; where T : class
{
    private readonly T value;

    public Maybe(T someValue)
    {
        if (someValue == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(someValue));
        this.value = someValue;
    }

    private Maybe()
    {
    }

    public Maybe&lt;U&gt; Bind&lt;U&gt;(Func&lt;T, Maybe&lt;U&gt;&gt; func) where U : class
    {
        return value != null ? func(value) : Maybe&lt;U&gt;.None();
    }

    public static Maybe&lt;T&gt; None() =&gt; new Maybe&lt;T&gt;();
}</code></pre>
<p>When <code>null</code> is not allowed, any API contract gets more explicit: either you
return type <code>T</code> and it&#39;s always going to be filled, or you return <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code>.
The client will see that <code>Maybe</code> type is used, so it will be forced to handle 
the case of absent value.</p>
<p>Given an imaginary repository contract (which does something with customers and
orders):</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public interface IMaybeAwareRepository
{
    Maybe&lt;Customer&gt; GetCustomer(int id);
    Maybe&lt;Address&gt; GetAddress(int id);
    Maybe&lt;Order&gt; GetOrder(int id);
}</code></pre>
<p>The client can be written with <code>Bind</code> method composition, without branching, 
in fluent style:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">Maybe&lt;Shipper&gt; shipperOfLastOrderOnCurrentAddress =
    repo.GetCustomer(customerId)
        .Bind(c =&gt; c.Address)
        .Bind(a =&gt; repo.GetAddress(a.Id))
        .Bind(a =&gt; a.LastOrder)
        .Bind(lo =&gt; repo.GetOrder(lo.Id))
        .Bind(o =&gt; o.Shipper);</code></pre>
<p>As we saw above, this syntax looks very much like a LINQ query with a bunch 
of <code>SelectMany</code> statements. One of the common 
implementations of <code>Maybe</code> implements <code>IEnumerable</code> interface to enable
a more C#-idiomatic binding composition. Actually:</p>
<h2 id="enumerable-selectmany-is-a-monad-">Enumerable + SelectMany is a Monad </h2>
<p><code>IEnumerable</code> is an interface for enumerable containers.</p>
<p>Enumerable containers can be created - thus the constructor monadic operation.</p>
<p>The <code>Bind</code> operation is defined by the standard LINQ extension method, here 
is its signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public static IEnumerable&lt;U&gt; SelectMany&lt;T, U&gt;(
    this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; first, 
    Func&lt;T, IEnumerable&lt;U&gt;&gt; selector)</code></pre>
<p>Direct implementation is quite straightforward:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static class Enumerable 
{
    public static IEnumerable&lt;U&gt; SelectMany(
        this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; values, 
        Func&lt;T, IEnumerable&lt;U&gt;&gt; func) 
    { 
        foreach (var item in values)
            foreach (var subItem in func(item))
                yield return subItem;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>And here is an example of composition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">IEnumerable&lt;Shipper&gt; shippers =
    customers
        .SelectMany(c =&gt; c.Addresses)
        .SelectMany(a =&gt; a.Orders)
        .SelectMany(o =&gt; o.Shippers);</code></pre>
<p>The query has no idea about how the collections are stored (encapsulated in
containers). We use functions <code>T -&gt; IEnumerable&lt;U&gt;</code> to produce new enumerables
(<code>Bind</code> operation).</p>
<h2 id="task-future-">Task (Future)</h2>
<p>In C# <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> type is used to denote asynchronous computation which will eventually
return an instance of <code>T</code>. The other names for similar concepts in other languages
are <code>Promise</code> and <code>Future</code>.</p>
<p>While the typical usage of <code>Task</code> in C# is different from the Monad pattern we
discussed, I can still come up with a <code>Future</code> class with the familiar structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class Future&lt;T&gt;
{
    private readonly Task&lt;T&gt; instance;

    public Future(T instance)
    {
        this.instance = Task.FromResult(instance);
    }

    private Future(Task&lt;T&gt; instance)
    {
        this.instance = instance;
    }

    public Future&lt;U&gt; Bind&lt;U&gt;(Func&lt;T, Future&lt;U&gt;&gt; func)
    {
        var a = this.instance.ContinueWith(t =&gt; func(t.Result).instance).Unwrap();
        return new Future&lt;U&gt;(a);
    }

    public void OnComplete(Action&lt;T&gt; action)
    {
        this.instance.ContinueWith(t =&gt; action(t.Result));
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Effectively, it&#39;s just a wrapper around the <code>Task</code> which doesn&#39;t add too much value,
but it&#39;s a useful illustration because now we can do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">repository
    .LoadSpeaker()
    .Bind(speaker =&gt; speaker.NextTalk())
    .Bind(talk =&gt; talk.GetConference())
    .Bind(conference =&gt; conference.GetCity())
    .OnComplete(city =&gt; reservations.BookFlight(city));</code></pre>
<p>We are back to the familiar structure. Time for some more complications.</p>
<h2 id="non-sequential-workflows">Non-Sequential Workflows</h2>
<p>Up until now, all the composed workflows had very liniar, sequential
structure: the output of a previous step was always the input for the next step.
That piece of data could be discarded after the first use because it was never needed 
for later steps:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again//linear-workflow.png" alt="Linear Workflow"></p>
<p>Quite often though, this might not be the case. A workflow step might need data
from two or more previous steps combined.</p>
<p>In the example above, <code>BookFlight</code> method might actually need both <code>Speaker</code> and
<code>City</code> objects:</p>
<p><img src="https://mikhail.io/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again//non-linear-workflow.png" alt="Non Linear Workflow"></p>
<p>In this case, we would have to use closure to save <code>speaker</code> object until we get
a <code>talk</code> too:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">repository
    .LoadSpeaker()
    .OnComplete(speaker =&gt;
        speaker
            .NextTalk()
            .Bind(talk =&gt; talk.GetConference())
            .Bind(conference =&gt; conference.GetCity())
            .OnComplete(city =&gt; reservations.BookFlight(speaker, city))
        );</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, this gets ugly very soon.</p>
<p>To solve this structural problem, C# language got its <code>async</code>-<code>await</code> feature,
which is now being reused in more languages including Javascript.</p>
<p>If we move back to using <code>Task</code> instead of our custom <code>Future</code>, we are able to
write</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var speaker = await repository.LoadSpeaker();
var talk = await speaker.NextTalk();
var conference = await talk.GetConference();
var city = await conference.GetCity();
await reservations.BookFlight(speaker, city);</code></pre>
<p>Even though we lost the fluent syntax, at least the block has just one level,
which makes it easier to navigate.</p>
<h2 id="monads-in-functional-languages">Monads in Functional Languages</h2>
<p>So far we learned that</p>
<ul>
<li>Monad is a workflow composition pattern</li>
<li>This pattern is used in functional programming</li>
<li>Special syntax helps simplify the usage</li>
</ul>
<p>It should come at no surprise that functional languages support monads on syntactic
level.</p>
<p>F# is a functional-first language running on .NET framework. F# had its own way of
doing workflows comparable to <code>async</code>-<code>await</code> before C# got it. In F#, the above
code would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let sendReservation () = async {
    let! speaker = repository.LoadSpeaker()
    let! talk = speaker.nextTalk()
    let! conf = talk.getConference()
    let! city = conf.getCity()
    do! bookFlight(speaker, city)
}</code></pre>
<p>Apart from syntax (<code>!</code> instead of <code>await</code>), the major difference to C# is that
<code>async</code> is just one possible monad type to be used this way. There are many
other monads in F# standard library (they are called Computation Expressions).</p>
<p>The best part is that any developer can create their own monads, and then use
all the power of language features.</p>
<p>Say, we want a hand-made <code>Maybe</code> computation expressoin in F#:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let nextTalkCity (speaker: Speaker) = maybe {
    let! talk = speaker.nextTalk()
    let! conf = talk.getConference()
    let! city = conf.getCity(talk)
    return city
}</code></pre>
<p>To make this code runnable, we need to define Maybe computation expression
builder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type MaybeBuilder() =

    member this.Bind(x, f) = 
        match x with
        | None -&gt; None
        | Some a -&gt; f a

    member this.Return(x) = 
        Some x

let maybe = new MaybeBuilder()</code></pre>
<p>I won&#39;t explain the details of what happens here, but you can see that the code is
quite trivial. Note the presence of <code>Bind</code> operation (and <code>Return</code> operation being
the monad constructor).</p>
<p>The feature is widely used by third-party F# libraries. Here is an actor definition
in Akka.NET F# API:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let loop () = actor {
    let! message = mailbox.Receive()
    match message with
    | Greet(name) -&gt; printfn &quot;Hello %s&quot; name
    | Hi -&gt; printfn &quot;Hello from F#!&quot;
    return! loop ()
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="monad-laws">Monad Laws</h2>
<p>There are a couple laws that constructor and <code>Bind</code> need to adhere to, so
that they produce a proper monad.</p>
<p>A typical monad tutorial will make a lot of emphasis on the laws, but I find them
less important to explain to a beginner. Nonetheless, here they are for the sake
of completeness.</p>
<p><strong>Left Identity law</strong> says that Monad constructor is a neutral operation: you can safely
run it before <code>Bind</code>, and it won&#39;t change the result of the function call:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">// Given
T value;
Func&lt;T, Monad&lt;U&gt;&gt; f;

// Then (== means both parts are equivalent)
new Monad&lt;T&gt;(value).Bind(f) == f(value) </code></pre>
<p><strong>Right Identity law</strong> says that given a monadic value, wrapping its contained data
into another monad of same type and then <code>Bind</code>ing it, doesn&#39;t change the original value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">// Given
Monad&lt;T&gt; monadicValue;

// Then (== means both parts are equivalent)
monadicValue.Bind(x =&gt; new Monad&lt;T&gt;(x)) == monadicValue</code></pre>
<p><strong>Associativity law</strong> means that the order in which <code>Bind</code> operations
are composed does not matter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">// Given
Monad&lt;T&gt; m;
Func&lt;T, Monad&lt;U&gt;&gt; f;
Func&lt;U, Monad&lt;V&gt;&gt; g;

// Then (== means both parts are equivalent)
m.Bind(f).Bind(g) == m.Bind(a =&gt; f(a).Bind(g))</code></pre>
<p>The laws may look complicated, but in fact they are very natural 
expectations that any developer has when working with monads, so don&#39;t
spend too much mental effort on memorizing them.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You should not be afraid of the &quot;M-word&quot; just because you are a C# programmer. </p>
<p>C# does not have a notion of monads as predefined language constructs, but 
that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t borrow some ideas from the functional world. Having 
said that, it&#39;s also true that C# is lacking some powerful ways to combine 
and generalize monads that are available in functional programming
languages.</p>
